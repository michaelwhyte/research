<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you take these bullet points and turn them into a summary paragraph or two...<em>Pasted summarized points from ChatGPT 4</em></p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>The PDF titled &quot;How Teacher and Grammarly Feedback Complement One Another in Myanmar EFL Students’ Writing&quot; examines the integration of automated feedback with traditional teacher feedback for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students in Myanmar. The authors analyze the focus of teacher and Grammarly feedback on language- and content-related issues in students&#39; writing and assess the effectiveness of feedback from different sources in students&#39; revisions. The study reveals that Grammarly primarily addresses surface-level errors, while teacher feedback encompasses both lower- and higher-level writing concerns, indicating potential for integration. The results indicate that students effectively utilize the received feedback, leading to improvements in their writing performance based on assessment criteria. The authors conclude that integrating automated feedback tools like Grammarly can alleviate the feedback workload for teachers, enabling them to concentrate more on higher-level writing skills. Additionally, the study underscores the pedagogical implications of merging automated and teacher feedback in EFL writing instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<p>Here are the main points from the article titled &quot;Enhancing learners’ critical thinking skills with AI-assisted technology&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The authors discuss the potential of AI chatbots like ChatGPT to revolutionize education, but also caution about the risks of relying on AI-generated answers without critical scrutiny.</p></li>
<li><p>They define critical thinking as a higher level of thinking that enables learners to think effectively and rationally, and break it down into three areas: understanding and analyzing ideas and arguments, evaluating ideas and arguments, and solving problems and making decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors propose a series of activities that integrate AI with coursebook materials to enhance learners’ critical thinking skills. These activities involve using AI to gather information, analyze and evaluate ideas, and solve problems.</p></li>
<li><p>They emphasize the importance of learners being active participants in their learning, questioning the assumptions behind the chatbot’s answers, and understanding not just the chatbot’s biases, but also their own.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors conclude by stating that AI is not going to disappear, and it is essential to teach learners to think critically and analyze and evaluate the information they get from this powerful new resource.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a short paragraph:</p>

<p>The article &quot;Enhancing learners’ critical thinking skills with AI-assisted technology&quot; discusses the potential of AI chatbots like ChatGPT in education and the importance of critical thinking. The authors propose a series of activities that integrate AI with coursebook materials to enhance learners’ critical thinking skills, including understanding and analyzing ideas and arguments, evaluating ideas and arguments, and solving problems and making decisions. They emphasize the importance of learners questioning the assumptions and biases of the chatbot and their own. The authors conclude by stating that as AI is here to stay, it is essential to teach learners to critically analyze and evaluate the information they get from this powerful new resource.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Additional Notes</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These notes are added for the examples section of the essay...I thought the section of the article that deals with specific examples would be helpful for this section of the essay...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Learners can save time using chatbots like ChatGPT to find information for an essay, but if a chatbot will do the whole thing for them, they may not need to put any effort in at all...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>If they don&#39;t put in any effort into project, chances are low that they may not learn in the process of doing the project which defeats on of the purposes of an assessment and that is to ensure students demonstrate their understanding and achivement of a skill, a piece of knowledge, or courselearning objective...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>...what if learners do not check whether the chatbot’s answer is any good? Worse still, what if learners do not have the critical thinking skills to scrutinise the chatbot’s answers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Good point...we need to teach students how to look at outputs from AI-LLMs with a critical eye, to always question the output or to know how to verify information provided by an AI-LLM</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">What is critical thinking?</h2>

<p><strong>ChatGPT summary of this section</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Critical thinking is a higher level of thinking that helps learners think effectively and rationally.</p></li>
<li><p>It involves three areas: </p>

<ol>
<li>Understanding and analyzing ideas and arguments</li>
<li>Evaluating ideas and arguments</li>
<li>Solving problems and making decisions</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding and analyzing ideas and arguments</strong> involves identifying patterns and relationships in information to gain a deeper understanding and make inferences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluating ideas and arguments</strong> requires judging the reliability of arguments and evidence, helping learners draw appropriate conclusions and construct strong arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solving problems and making decisions</strong> involves identifying and analyzing problems, gathering information, evaluating options, making decisions, and evaluating those decisions for further refinement.</p></li>
<li><p><mark>Technology, such as chatbots, can be used to enhance the focus on developing critical thinking skills by providing additional support and resources for learners.</mark></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The follow has large chunks of text taking from the original article, be careful using this text directly in your essay</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above paragraph is me paraphrases the thoughts of the author...</p>

<p>Authentic Assignment Idea using AI to help students Learn following a series of assessments that enable students to discover knowledge on their own, but also question it, analyze it, and enhance it with their own understanding of a topic...</p>

<p>Below is an idea, taking a single concept and through a series of assessments allowing students to use AI while still learning about a topic and developing critical thinking skills...</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Idea 1</h3>

<h4 id="toc_7">Combining AI with coursebook materials to enhance learners’ critical thinking</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>How should we prevent diseases from spreading? The debate on this is less about the steps needed and more about who should be responsible for implementing them. Should individuals and families or governments take the lead in disease prevention?</p></li>
<li><p>One of the writing tasks in Unlock asks learners to produce an essay on this topic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is disease prevention the responsibility of individuals and their families, or of the government? </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The traditional way for learners to answer such a question would be to research the issues, finding voices from all sides of the debate, evaluating them alongside their own opinions to produce a conclusion. Although the coursebook already provides lots of support for learners throughout these steps, using AI as an alternative in some of these steps can provide a quick way of helping learners find relevant information and formulate answers, whilst presenting them with an activity that challenges their ability to think critically.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">Idea 2</h3>

<h4 id="toc_9">Understanding and analysing ideas and arguments</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, learners could be asked to brainstorm ten different ways of preventing diseases. </p></li>
<li><p>They could then ask a chatbot to list 10 ways of preventing diseases, and compare their own lists with these ideas. From this they can see which list contains more of a focus on individual responsibility and which has more focus on government responsibility. </p></li>
<li><p>Try it yourself and see what the chatbot focuses on. Why do you think the chatbot has answered in this way? By carrying out this type of activity, learners raise their awareness of the unintentional biases which can be present in chatbots’ outputs and can find strategies to ensure they include a balanced set of points in their arguments and essays.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_10">Idea 3</h3>

<h4 id="toc_11">Evaluating ideas and arguments</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Next, learners can ask the chatbot to write a short essay on the question ‘Is disease prevention the responsibility of individuals and their families, or of the government?’ Then ask learners the following questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Are the points made in the text the most important points to consider? </li>
<li>Which of the points are the most important? </li>
<li>Does the chatbot choose the right point to focus on?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Having considered these points, learners can write their own version of their essay, choosing from their own ideas for preventing disease from their initial brainstorm and adding in any other good points they liked from the chatbot’s answer, while trying to improve on it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_12">Idea 4</h3>

<h4 id="toc_13">Solving problems and making decisions</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, learners can use the information they have gathered so far to apply it to a real-world problem and come to a decision about how best to solve it. Learners can either choose a health issue that affects them, or ask a chatbot to generate a list of common health issues in society. </p></li>
<li><p>Teachers could set up a class debate about one of the problems. One side argues for individual responsibility and the other for government responsibility to tackle the issue, and have them present their solutions to the class. The class can then vote for the best argument and explain their choice. As a fun final activity, they could even ask the chatbot to choose the best solution to the problem and discuss why the answer was the same as their own, or different.</p></li>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> since AI can now generate text and other media with ease on a wide variety of topics...it means traditional assessments such as standard tests, and knowledge based essays may become less important in determining student success or achievement of learning objectives...because of this authentic assessments (where students generate an output similar to a real world scenario, using a variety of media) may rise in importance because having students analyze a topic in a debate or do a live presentation or an interview to showcase their knowledge is difficult to do on the fly with AI...So therefore students can use AI to gather knowledge but must use their own abilities to analyse that knowledge and demonstrate it...Are their articles out their that discuss this? Do not use the this resource please: cadmus.io</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there are articles that discuss this topic. Authentic assessments are becoming more important as AI can now generate text and other media with ease on a wide variety of topics. Traditional assessments such as standard tests and knowledge-based essays may become less important in determining student success or achievement of learning objectives. Authentic assessments require students to generate an output similar to a real-world scenario using a variety of media. This is difficult to do on the fly with AI. Therefore, students can use AI to gather knowledge but must use their own abilities to analyze that knowledge and demonstrate it [1, 2].</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>In a short paragraph:</p>

<p>The article by John M. Richardson, an adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Education, discusses the integration of AI chatbots like ChatGPT into classrooms. He proposes a five-part framework for this integration, which includes planning teaching around a robust pedagogy, reflecting how practitioners use AI in their discipline, redesigning assessments in light of AI, providing opportunities for students to learn from both AI-powered apps and human teachers, and dividing the curriculum into three areas: foundational skills, newly transformed skills, and analytical skills. Richardson emphasizes the importance of teaching students to work ethically with AI and the need for human-centered learning. He concludes by stating that this framework is designed to support educators in meeting students&#39; needs during a time of rapid technological change.</p>

<p><strong>I asked ChatGPT to expand on point 2...</strong></p>

<p>The five-part framework for integrating AI chatbots into classrooms, as proposed by the author, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Robust Pedagogy:</strong> Teaching should be planned around a robust pedagogy that positions AI as a tool for engaged students to get important things done. The author suggests pedagogies like &quot;real-world learning&quot; and &quot;teaching for understanding&quot; that inspire active learning and ongoing feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflecting Practitioner Use of AI:</strong> Educators should teach in ways that reflect how practitioners use AI in their discipline. For instance, science students can use AI like scientists to analyze data sets and review research papers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Redesigning Assessments:</strong> Assessments should be redesigned in light of AI. Some tasks will explicitly ask for students to use AI tools, while others will be AI-proof. Assessments should be designed so that students must work ethically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balancing AI-Powered Learning and Human Teaching:</strong> Students should have opportunities to teach themselves with new AI-powered apps while also learning from caring and compassionate human teachers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dividing the Curriculum:</strong> Instructors should divide their curriculum into three areas: foundational skills that every student in a discipline should be able to accomplish without access to AI, newly transformed skills that students should henceforth always expect to do with AI, and analytical skills that involve taking critical perspectives and making ethical judgements.</p></li>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Here are the main points from the PDF titled &quot;ChatGPT: five priorities for research&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The authors discuss the implications of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), on the way researchers work. They note that ChatGPT can produce sophisticated and seemingly intelligent writing after training on a massive dataset of text.</p></li>
<li><p>They highlight that while ChatGPT can accelerate the innovation process, shorten time-to-publication, and increase the diversity of scientific perspectives, it can also degrade the quality and transparency of research and spread misinformation.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors emphasize the importance of human verification, noting that the use of conversational AI for specialized research can introduce inaccuracies, bias, and plagiarism. They provide examples of how ChatGPT can generate false and misleading text.</p></li>
<li><p>They call for the development of rules for accountability, suggesting that author-contribution statements and acknowledgements in research papers should clearly state whether and to what extent AI technologies were used in the preparation of their manuscript and analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors advocate for the development and implementation of open-source AI technology to counter the lack of transparency in proprietary AI technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>They discuss the potential benefits of AI, such as accelerating innovation and potentially leading to breakthroughs across many disciplines, provided that issues related to bias, provenance, and inaccuracies are addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors call for a wider debate on the disruptive potential of LLMs, recommending immediate discussions within research groups and an international forum on the development and responsible use of LLMs for research.</p></li>
<li><p>They conclude by emphasizing the need to embrace the opportunities and manage the risks of AI in science, without losing the important aspects of scientific work such as curiosity, imagination, and discovery.</p></li>

<p>Here are the main points from the article titled &quot;How ChatGPT Can Improve Education, Not Threaten It&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The author, a professor at UCLA, argues against banning the use of AI tools like ChatGPT in education, stating that students should be taught to use them ethically and productively instead.</p></li>
<li><p>He believes that students need to learn how to prompt an AI writing tool to elicit worthwhile output and know how to evaluate its quality, accuracy, and originality.</p></li>
<li><p>The author suggests that it is not feasible to effectively ban access to AI technology like ChatGPT, as many students will be unable to resist the temptation to seek AI assistance with their writing.</p></li>
<li><p>He also argues that enforcing a ChatGPT ban would inevitably produce injustice due to false positives and negatives, with some students being falsely accused of using ChatGPT.</p></li>
<li><p>The author emphasizes that learning to successfully combine unassisted and AI-assisted writing to create good essays also requires focused, disciplined thinking.</p></li>

<p><strong>ChatGPT 3.5 Summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<ul>
<li>AI in education has raised concerns, including the impact on the reputation of academic institutions and the devaluation of university qualifications.</li>
<li>One of the most significant concerns is the effect of AI on student learning, which worries higher education staff.</li>
<li>Academics fear that students may misuse AI tools for plagiarism or misuse research data.</li>
<li>Implementing AI technology to monitor and investigate academic misconduct can be costly in terms of time and resources for already overloaded academic staff.</li>
<li>Many academics feel overwhelmed by their workload, especially those from underserved populations.</li>
<li><strong>Despite concerns, it is seen as futile to try to battle AI technology or prevent its use, as some students already approach learning with a convenience-oriented mindset.</strong></li>
<li>Some new scholarly perspectives are embracing the possibilities of AI in education.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I asked ChatGPT 3.5 for clarification on the bolded point above</strong></p>

<p>...The reference to a &quot;convenience-oriented mindset&quot; suggests that some students may prioritize convenience and efficiency in their approach to learning. With the advent of AI tools and technologies, students have access to various resources that can assist them in their academic tasks, such as automated essay generators, online research tools, or plagiarism detection software.</p>

<p>However, this convenience-oriented mindset can have drawbacks. It raises concerns that students might misuse these AI tools to plagiarize assignments or improperly use research data. Instead of engaging in genuine learning and critical thinking, they may rely heavily on AI to complete their tasks quickly and easily. This convenience-oriented mindset can undermine the integrity and quality of their education.</p>

<p>While some scholars and educators recognize the potential benefits of AI in education, they also acknowledge the need to address these concerns and strike a balance between leveraging AI technology and promoting responsible and ethical learning practices.     </p>

<p><strong>ChatGPT 3.5 Summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) has a history of nearly 70 years, starting in the 1950s when the concept of intelligent machines was proposed.</li>
<li>The field of AI progressed from solving simple problems like checkers to more advanced systems such as decision support and planning systems, which found applications in business and education.</li>
<li>The emergence of Neural Networks and Machine Learning in the late 20th century brought AI into the public consciousness as a tool for improving quality of life.</li>
<li>Neural Networks allowed machines to make predictions and forecasts with greater precision than humans, leading to their integration in various domains where their expertise surpassed human capabilities.</li>
<li>AI evolved from mastering toy problems like chess and Jeopardy! to recognizing images and sounds, contributing to advancements in voice and image recognition in consumer devices.</li>
<li>In the 21st century, corporations recognized the value of aggregating large amounts of data for data warehousing and analytics purposes, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and detailed profiling of individuals.</li>
<li>The progress of AI has accelerated in recent years, with AI models like ChatGPT (LLM AI) bringing about radical changes in how people work, live, and learn.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_29">The Advent of ChatGPT</h2>

<ul>
<li>when we asked ChatGPT “Describe in one sentence why you were made” it said:

<ul>
<li><em>I was made to provide conversational assistance and answer a wide range of questions to help people find information and complete tasks more easily.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But this is not just a preformatted answer. Instead, if we were to ask again, we’d be given a slightly different but similar result:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I was made to provide natural language processing and generate human-like responses to facilitate communication between humans and machines.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT generates its output based on the prompt, using a pre-trained model that has been built from a large corpus of data (big data) that ChatGPT has scraped the internet for. Using this data, ChatGPT creates sentences and paragraphs based on what others have said about a topic in the past, stringing together words to construct a novel and creative answer that is slightly different each time.</p></li>
<li><p>Intriguingly, this means that ChatGPT does not actually understand what it’s saying, but in the classic approach, leaves us to wonder that if it ‘looks like a duck and quacks like a duck’, does it matter whether it actually is a duck?</p></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Good point on the number of academic articles on ChatGPT at the time this article was published...</p>

<ul>
<li>As of 21 February 2023, there were <em>21 articles listed in Scopus that use ChatGPT in title, abstract, or keywords</em>...DQ...

<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Text emphasis formatting added by me...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT itself indicates that this [whether ChatGPT should be listed as a co-author] should be based on careful assessment of contributions (when asked “Should ChatGPT be listed as an author on academic papers?”):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ultimately, the decision of whether to list ChatGPT as an author on an academic paper should be based on a careful assessment of its contributions to the work and should be guided by established academic conventions and ethical standards.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>in the context of blind studies, human reviewers correctly identified 68 percent of ChatGPT generated abstracts and 86 percent of genuine abstracts, but incorrectly identified the rest...a doctoral candidate with minimal training in grading papers or integrity-detection may have considerable challenge in identifying when students use the AI tool to cheat...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>University of Tasmania (2023) releasing a Statement on the Use of Artificial Intelligence to students and staff:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>You can use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn, just like you would study with a classmate or ask a friend for advice. You are not permitted to present the output of generative AI as your own work for your assignments or other assessment tasks. This constitutes an academic integrity breach. In some units, a unit coordinator may explicitly allow or require the use of AI in your assessment task.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>The Reddit ChatGPT thread had a post in February 2023 on using ChatGPT to write a paper...</p></li>
<li><p>The Reddit ChatGPT – an online forum – offers an early case of the opportunity that ChatGPT provides for students to cheat on their studies. On 21 February 2023 for example, one popular post included a two-line memetic call-and-response “Open AI: ‘We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.’ College students:” followed by an image of a student with an A+ paper, a “what if you never had to do homework again” on the page, and a book titled “The Homework Machine” (see Reddit, 2023).</p></li>
<li><p>Here is the Reddit post:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/117fie2/openai_weve_trained_a_model_called_chatgpt_which/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/117fie2/openai_weve_trained_a_model_called_chatgpt_which/</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Here is the image that the above point is referring to:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/figure-01.jpg" alt="Student holding a paper with a grade of A+, with text implying AI did the homework"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>we asked ChatGPT “What is the main risk of using ChatGPT-3 for assignment writing” it summarised:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>While ChatGPT-3 can be a helpful tool for generating ideas and providing structure for your writing, it is important to use it in conjunction with your own critical thinking, analysis, and research. It is also important to be aware of the risks associated with relying too heavily on ChatGPT-3 and to take steps to avoid plagiarism and ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information you include in your writing.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_30">The need for good leadership in teaching ChatGPT</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In a recent Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice editorial, the Editor-in-Chief introduced publication sections that focused on good leadership and educational psychology to better understand and enhance how students engage with learning (Crawford, 2023) [1]. In these scenarios it was the leadership of teachers that influenced the extent to which students would engage in effective or ineffective (e.g., cheating) learning.it was the leadership of teachers that influenced the extent to which students would engage in effective or ineffective (e.g., cheating) learning...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>When asking ChatGPT “Can good teacher leadership improve students use of ChatGPT-3 to learn?”, it summarised:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Overall, good teacher leadership can play an important role in helping students use ChatGPT-3 effectively to learn. By providing guidance and direction, promoting critical thinking and analysis, providing formative feedback, and encouraging collaboration and discussion, teachers can help students become more effective and engaged learners.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is our proposition therefore that to combat prospective cheating or misuse of the ChatGPT application, and future artificial intelligence chatbots and tools, by cultivating a sense of moral character in students as an imperative. </p>

<ul>
<li>This may be through:

<ul>
<li>effective teacher role modelling</li>
<li>through leadership development opportunities</li>
<li>through continuous self-awareness</li>
<li>ethics</li>
<li>decision-making training </li>
</ul></li>
<li>The above are to build critical thinkers with a firm moral compass.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above is mostly a ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>effective leadership opportunities embedded into core curriculum may pose a possible antidote to whatever future convenience that students might be afforded by difficult-to- detect cheating practices...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Having teachers discuss with students about using AI in ways that hinder their learning might be more effective than trying to rely on discovering cheating...</li>
<li>By having teachers act as leaders and guiding students on the potential drawbacks of certain uses of AI that can hinder their learning, we can potentially counteract any convenience that students may experience from engaging in difficult-to-detect cheating practices...

<ul>
<li>The above point was a rephrase from ChatGPT 3.5 - May 27, 2023, based on the authors original text and some follow prompts by me...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The future-focused promotion of good practice and character development does not forego the need for detection, as undetected cheating could lead to future character erosion, but rather offers a multipronged response that serves as more effective than only focusing on prevention or prescription; a fact that mental health scholars have known for some time (e.g., LaMontagne et al., 2014) [2]...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the main points from the article titled &quot;Thinking about our assessments in the age of artificial intelligence (AI)&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The authors discuss the impact of AI chatbots like ChatGPT on education, prompting educators to rethink their teaching, learning, and assessment strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>They propose a series of strategies for integrating AI into classrooms, including <strong>embracing authentic assessments</strong>, creating social learning opportunities, focusing on process over product, asking students to get creative, being transparent about expectations for AI use, having students explore AI tools, and getting creative with technology.</p></li>

<li><p>The authors conclude by stating that AI provides an exciting opportunity to reimagine a more resilient, equitable, and creative system of assessment.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a short paragraph:</p>

<p>The article &quot;Thinking about our assessments in the age of artificial intelligence (AI)&quot; discusses the impact of AI chatbots like ChatGPT on education and proposes strategies for integrating AI into classrooms. These strategies include embracing authentic assessments, creating social learning opportunities, focusing on process over product, asking students to get creative, being transparent about expectations for AI use, having students explore AI tools, and getting creative with technology. The authors suggest that AI can help students learn and revise their writing, guide studying, answer questions, search references, and reflect on and expand their ideas. They encourage educators to explore new AI tools and consider AI as an opportunity to reimagine a more resilient, equitable, and creative system of assessment.</p>

<p><strong>I asked ChatGPT for some more information on &quot;embracing authentic assessments from point 2...</strong></p>

<p>The five-part framework for integrating AI chatbots into classrooms, as proposed by the author, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Embrace Authentic Assessments:</strong> The author suggests refocusing course activities so that students can apply their learning to real-world contexts and problems, which can positively influence both motivation and long-term memory. Authentic assessments teach students how to approach multifaceted, complex questions where there is not always a right answer, and develop their analytical skills. One example given is engaging students in creating a portfolio of their work with critical reflections on how course experiences and activities have impacted their learning and, if relevant, the impact on the communities in which they are situated. A learning portfolio is a visible way to help students develop metacognitive (thinking about thinking) skills, become critical thinkers, and open a space for reflective dialogue with the instructor to track and adjust their learning progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create Social Learning Opportunities:</strong> The author highlights the importance of social interactions for learning. Group activities with well-designed questions or prompts can provide students the opportunity to articulate and challenge their own understanding of concepts, integrate other perspectives, and reveal gaps in their knowledge. They can also motivate students to come prepared to engage in these activities with their peers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on Process Over Product:</strong> Traditionally, the end product of a paper or project has carried most of the weight for assessing learning. As AI improves, and it will improve rapidly, reframing our priorities by weighting process and value, revision and improvement more heavily will be important. When designing a writing assignment or a project, instructors might break it into smaller components that assess skill development at each stage, using self and peer feedback submitted with changes prior to instructor feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask Students to Get Creative:</strong> Projects that engage students in thinking beyond the traditional disciplinary modes of communication can give students valuable experience translating dense concepts for different audiences. Consider alternative models for students to express their learning, such as conference posters, information graphics, podcasts, maps, artwork, storyboards, song writing, poetry, or research presentations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be Transparent About Your Expectations for the Use of AI:</strong> One of the easiest ways to encourage authentic engagement with course activities and to discourage academic dishonesty is to be transparent about your expectations. Include a statement in your syllabus that tells students what is (and is not) allowed in your course. Be explicit about how students should cite the work of others and a policy for citing the use of AI tools in learning or in their work.</p></li>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you elaborate on this point from your previous response: &quot;The authors also discuss challenges that may arise from the use of AI in education, including inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, and social and ethical issues.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>The authors of the paper discuss several challenges that may arise from the use of AI in education:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Inappropriate Use of AI Techniques: The authors note that students might not always use AI techniques appropriately for a specific learning context. This could lead to negative attitudes towards learning. For instance, students might rely too heavily on AI tools for tasks they should be doing themselves, or they might use AI tools in ways that don&#39;t actually support their learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing Roles of Teachers and Students: The authors suggest that the advancement of AI could potentially change the roles of teachers and students. For example, as AI tools become more capable of providing personalized instruction, the role of the teacher might shift from direct instruction to more of a facilitator or guide. This could also affect how students interact with teachers and with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Social and Ethical Issues: The authors also highlight potential social and ethical issues related to the use of AI in education. These could include concerns about data privacy and security, the potential for bias in AI algorithms, and the ethical implications of using AI to make decisions about students&#39; learning.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The authors suggest that these challenges need to be carefully considered and addressed as AI continues to be integrated into educational practices. They also emphasize the importance of ongoing research to better understand these issues and develop strategies for addressing them.</p>

<p><strong>Due to a 25 prompt limitation every 3 hours for ChatGPT 4 model, I decided to use the unlimited (I think) ChatGPT 3.5 model for the next prompt...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 3.5</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What is swarm intelligence in the context of education and learning?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Swarm intelligence in the context of education and learning refers to the application of principles inspired by the collective behavior of social insect colonies, such as ants, bees, and termites, to enhance the learning process and educational outcomes.</p>

<p>Swarm intelligence recognizes that social insect colonies exhibit highly organized and efficient behaviors without the need for central control or individual intelligence. Instead, they rely on decentralized decision-making and coordination among large numbers of relatively simple individuals. This concept can be applied to education to foster collaborative learning, problem-solving, and knowledge sharing among students.</p>

<p>In an educational context, swarm intelligence can manifest in various ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Collaborative Learning: Swarm intelligence emphasizes the power of collaboration among students. It encourages group work, discussions, and knowledge sharing, allowing students to leverage the collective intelligence of the group to solve problems and learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer-to-Peer Learning: Similar to how social insects communicate and learn from each other, swarm intelligence in education promotes peer-to-peer learning. Students can teach and mentor each other, fostering a supportive learning environment where knowledge is shared horizontally.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed Decision-Making: Swarm intelligence recognizes that decision-making can be distributed among multiple individuals. In the context of education, this means involving students in decision-making processes, such as choosing learning activities, setting goals, and determining project directions. It empowers students and encourages autonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptive Learning: Swarm intelligence acknowledges the adaptive nature of social insects. In education, this can be applied through personalized and adaptive learning systems that tailor educational content and approaches to the individual needs and learning styles of each student.</p></li>
<li><p>Collective Problem-Solving: Swarm intelligence emphasizes the power of collective problem-solving. By engaging students in collaborative projects and real-world challenges, it encourages them to work together, pool their knowledge and skills, and find innovative solutions as a group.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Swarm intelligence in education aims to create an environment that promotes active engagement, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. By harnessing the collective intelligence and collaborative efforts of students, it seeks to enhance the learning experience and improve educational outcomes. </p>

<li><p>It was noted that individuals with low language and literacy skills may struggle with visual questions.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal for ChatGPT4, an AI model, was set to achieve a minimum of 80% performance on the PISA test in all categories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>The talk questioned whether the current testing system and curriculum should change to adapt to the AI era. It also raised the idea of teaching students different skills in a world influenced by AI.</mark></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Andreas Schleicher, during his speech, emphasized the need to consider what makes us human and how we can complement AI instead of substituting it. He cautioned against becoming overly reliant on algorithms without full understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>Michele Bruniges mentioned that education is at a tipping point and that students should be allowed access to AI during testing to reflect the real world.</mark></strong></p></li>
<li><p>The need for relevant and up-to-date curriculum to keep students engaged was emphasized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>Developing digital skills and understanding how to effectively use AI systems (Digital Intelligence) were considered important for students. Determining the skills AI is not good at was identified as a challenge.</mark></strong></p></li>
<li><p>The role of teachers was discussed. It was debated whether AI would make teachers irrelevant or if they would transition into becoming coaches guiding learners through their education.</p></li>
<li><p>The question of whether AI would improve or hinder education equity was raised. The speaker believed it would improve equity.</p></li>
<li><p>The need for agility in education and careful consideration of the issues at hand was stressed.</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of critically assessing information and not blindly accepting it due to AI&#39;s ability to generate convincing but false information was highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>Audience polls indicated that a significant portion favored a transformational change in what students should be learning and the role of teachers.</mark></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>During the audience question session, the discussion turned to assessment. The need to update assessments to better align with desired outcomes and the potential for more innovative assessments due to AI were mentioned.</mark></strong></p></li>

<p>Certainly! Based on the initial summary, here are two key points or themes that emerge:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Balancing AI and Human Skills:</strong> The conference talk highlighted the need to strike a balance between AI and human skills in education. It emphasized that while AI can provide valuable tools and automation, it should complement human abilities rather than replace them entirely. The discussions revolved around identifying the skills AI excels at and determining the skills where human involvement is crucial. This theme underscores the importance of understanding what makes us human and fostering skills and attributes that AI cannot replicate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adapting Education for the AI Era:</strong> Another key point was the necessity of adapting education to meet the demands of an AI-driven world. The talk explored the need for changes in curriculum, assessment methods, and teaching approaches to align with the evolving landscape influenced by AI. There was an emphasis on incorporating digital skills and teaching students how to effectively navigate and critically evaluate AI-generated information. Additionally, the discussion raised questions about the role of teachers in guiding students&#39; learning journeys and the potential impact of AI on educational equity.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, these two key points reflect the ongoing dialogue on harnessing the potential of AI while ensuring that education remains relevant, engaging, and focused on developing skills that are uniquely human and essential for success in an AI-powered future.</p>

<h1 id="toc_52">05-00 ChatGPT 4 - Role of AI in Education</h1>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Bing</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 27, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What is the role of AI in education in regards to assessment of students</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been playing an increasingly significant role in the field of education, particularly in the area of student assessment. As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, here are some ways AI has been utilized:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Automated grading</strong>: AI algorithms can evaluate and grade student work, including multiple-choice exams, fill-in-the-blank questions, and even more complex tasks like essays. This can save teachers significant time and ensure consistency in grading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personalized feedback</strong>: AI can provide individualized feedback to students based on their performance. This can help students understand where they&#39;re struggling and what they need to do to improve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptive learning systems</strong>: These systems use AI to assess a student&#39;s current knowledge level, learning pace, and learning style. The system then adjusts the learning material to best suit the student&#39;s needs. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictive analytics</strong>: AI can analyze student data to predict future performance and identify areas where a student may need extra help. This can enable early interventions to prevent students from falling behind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cheating detection</strong>: AI can also be used to detect anomalies in student behavior that could indicate cheating, such as unusual patterns in online test responses or suspicious activity during remote exams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competency-based assessments</strong>: AI can help create and grade assessments that measure specific skills or competencies, rather than rote memorization. This can provide a more accurate picture of a student&#39;s abilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Game-based assessments</strong>: AI can be used in educational games to both engage students and assess their skills in real-time. The AI can adapt the game based on the student&#39;s performance, providing a dynamic, interactive assessment tool.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, it&#39;s important to note that while AI can greatly assist in the assessment process, it&#39;s not a replacement for human educators. AI tools can sometimes struggle with understanding the nuances of human language and behavior, and the feedback and grading provided by a human teacher can often be more accurate and insightful. Additionally, there are ethical and privacy considerations to be taken into account when using AI in education.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you want the most recent information or specific examples, and I can use my browsing tool to find that information.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Use bing to find out how AI can be utilized in the context of Authentic Assessment to help students gather knowledge and enhance their learning experience as of 2023...</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This response errored out, but the model did manage to output some text...</p>

<p><a id="response-02"></a><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>As of 2023, AI is being utilized in the context of Authentic Assessment to enhance students&#39; learning experiences in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI, such as ChatGPT, can synthesize existing knowledge and organize it into logical arguments. While these AI bots cannot generate novel or creative ideas, they can support student learning of core content and extend critical digital literacy skills​1​.</li>
<li>When AI is integrated into teaching and learning, it can increase students’ engagement. For example, AI can help with remembering and working with basic content ideas (e.g., facts, figures, knowledge), and making connections between ideas (e.g., to organize ideas into a logical argument, to compare and contrast, to synthesize). However, it can&#39;t yet achieve &quot;extension-level&quot; learning, which involves creating novel, critical, and creative outputs. This remains the role and function of students​1.</li>
<li>To avoid misuse of AI in academic assessments, educators can use several key practices, such as being explicit about learning goals and the role of AI in assessments, engaging in feedback cycles, using performance tasks and authentic assessments, and collaboratively grading assessments with students​1​.</li>
<li>However, it&#39;s important to note that AI also presents challenges for academic integrity, as students can use tools like ChatGPT to generate text-based responses that appear to be authentic student work. There is a concern that AI could usher in a new age of plagiarism and cheating​1​.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite searching, I wasn&#39;t able to find detailed examples of specific Authentic Assessment strategies that incorporate AI. Further investigation might be needed to provide more concrete examples of how AI is being utilized in this context.</p>

<p><strong>On a second attempt...I gave a response more on using an AI detection tool to ensure academic integrity...Which was not what I was looking for...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Actually I didn&#39;t mean &quot;authentic assessment&quot; to be reducing cheating...What I meant is since AI can now generate text and other media with ease on a wide variety of topics...it means traditional assessments such as standard tests, and knowledge based essays may become less important in determining student success or achievement of learning objectives...because of this authentic assessments (where students generate an output similar to a real world scenario, using a variety of media) may rise in importance because having students analyze a topic in a debate or do a live presentation or an interview to showcase their knowledge is difficult to do on the fly with AI...So therefore students can use AI to gather knowledge but must use their own abilities to analyse that knowledge and demonstrate it...Are their articles out their that discuss this...Or does what I say make sense?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>I understand your point better now. You&#39;re suggesting that as AI becomes more capable of producing text and other forms of content, traditional assessments that rely on recalling or reproducing information may become less relevant. Instead, &quot;authentic assessments&quot; where students have to apply their knowledge in real-world-like scenarios will be more useful in determining their true understanding and skill. This would require students to analyze and interpret the information they&#39;ve gathered, possibly with the help of AI, and demonstrate their understanding in ways that can&#39;t be easily replicated by an AI.</p>

<p>Your reasoning certainly makes sense. AI is great at handling large amounts of information and performing repetitive tasks, but it lacks the human ability to interpret, apply, and present information in a unique and meaningful way. Therefore, assessments that require these higher-level cognitive skills would indeed be more valuable in an educational environment where AI is widely used.</p>

<p>As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, there has been a growing interest in the educational community to shift towards more authentic assessments for these very reasons. The idea is that these types of assessments better measure a student&#39;s ability to apply knowledge and skills in realistic contexts and offer a more holistic view of student learning. </p>

<p>However, for the most recent information or specific articles discussing this topic in the context of AI advancements, I would need to use my browsing tool. Would you like me to do that?</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Yes, please your your browsing tool...</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This response errored out...I have only include the bit that is relavent to my topic as some of the rest was again about using a tool to ensure academic integrity...I think the tool in question here <a href="https://www.cadmus.io/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-risks-of-ai-in-authentic-assessment-practices">Cadmus</a> has some good SEO on the topic as Bing seems to really want to use this resource...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Partial response...I am only including the relavent bit...</p>

<p>...To ensure meaningful learning and assessment in the age of AI, educators are being encouraged to refocus on authentic assessments that involve real-world contexts and problems, allowing students to apply their learning in meaningful ways. Additionally, creating social learning opportunities and focusing on the learning process over the final product are other strategies being adopted. More creative forms of student expression are also being encouraged, such as conference posters, information graphics, podcasts, maps, artwork, storyboards, song writing, poetry, or research presentations. Transparency about expectations for the use of AI in coursework is crucial, and educators are also encouraged to have students explore AI tools themselves to understand their strengths and limitations​ [1]​...</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I thought ChatGPT&#39;s orginal response on this topic (<a href="#response-02">response 02</a>) was good, so I decided to see if I could get ChatGPT to find the source of one of its previous statements...Since that original response was deleted, I had to use a new session using the same model as before, which was ChatGPT 4 with Bing...</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> In a previous session where I asked about AI and using authentic assessment as opposed to traditional assessment...You said this...&quot;AI, such as ChatGPT, can synthesize existing knowledge and organize it into logical arguments. While these AI bots cannot generate novel or creative ideas, they can support student learning of core content and extend critical digital literacy skills​&quot; ...It had a web resource attached to this statement...can you use your web browsing abilities to find that resource please...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>I believe I found a resource that matches your description. This Cambridge University Press article discusses how AI, specifically chatbots, can be used in conjunction with coursebook materials to enhance learners&#39; critical thinking skills. The article provides a detailed example of how learners can interact with a chatbot to gain different perspectives on a topic, critically evaluate those perspectives, and apply the information they gather to solve real-world problems. The article also emphasizes that through this process, learners become more aware of the biases and assumptions in the information they encounter, both from the chatbot and within their own thinking​ [1]​.</p>

<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2023/03/30/enhancing-learners-critical-thinking-skills-with-ai-assisted-technology/">https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2023/03/30/enhancing-learners-critical-thinking-skills-with-ai-assisted-technology/</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Good quote from the above resource:</strong></p>

<p><strong><mark>Firstly, learners could be asked to brainstorm ten different ways of preventing diseases</mark></strong>. </p>

<p><strong><mark>They could then ask a chatbot to list 10 ways of preventing diseases, and compare their own lists with these ideas. From this they can see which list contains more of a focus on individual responsibility and which has more focus on government responsibility</mark></strong>. </p>

<p><strong><mark>Try it yourself and see what the chatbot focuses on. Why do you think the chatbot has answered in this way? By carrying out this type of activity, learners raise their awareness of the unintentional biases which can be present in chatbots’ outputs and can find strategies to ensure they include a balanced set of points in their arguments and essays</mark></strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a ...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I gave this article a quick read and it is good...It provides a quick simple suggestion on how you can use AI tools like ChatGPT to show students how to use the tool while at the same time make sure students develop critical thinking skills</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This is true, writing well is a full time pursuit...A profession...Most people do not have time to dedicate to perfecting their writing...especially in a world that just needs the infortmation quickly. As long as the writing is clear, it is often good enough for the everyday world...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If ChatGPT didn’t work for the kinds of writing we assign and assess at the undergraduate level, we would have nothing to worry about. And for that reason, <mark>I don’t think this is an academic integrity issue — I think it’s an assessment integrity issue</mark>. We treat those like they are the same thing, but they’re not...DQ...</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>But much like most of us used to tell our students to stay away from Wikipedia (which is a bad comparison on many levels, not least because it was always misguided advice), we have a losing battle on our hands.

<ul>
<li>If a tool is used in the real world, it is better not to keep students from it...Instead we should show students how to use it...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_54">Solutions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Talk to students about ChatGPT. What are its problems and shortcomings? How do you see the work it produces as falling short of your standards? What do you see as the AI implications in your discipline?</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate for process, not just product. When we only collect the finished product, there&#39;s little incentive for students to learn the process — and the kind of thinking essay writing requires means a lot of process work. Help students to understand <em>how</em> to write well in your discipline and how to establish good habits around writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Include reflection in your assessments, both in terms of how the content is relevant to students and in terms of the process they undertook. Thinking though how an assignment went (especially before the instructor marks it) can really help students to develop skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Think critically about your assessments. If you assign essays, do you have a reason for that? And do you provide essay writing instruction? The essay is often the default mode of assessment, but that puts a lot of pressure on the final product, and often students have little support in developing it. Are there other ways to assess learning that might be more effective?</p></li>

<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t give up on the essay. I would probably give a lot less weight to the final paper and a lot more weight to the process of thinking through an argument, but I ultimately still believe that thinking through ideas in writing is a valuable practice.

<h2 id="toc_56">ChatGPT4 with Link Reader Plugin - Summary</h2>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p>The blog post discusses the implications of AI, particularly ChatGPT, on writing assignments in the university setting. Here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Undervaluing Writing in Universities</strong>: The author argues that universities do not value writing as they should. Most writing instruction is done by graduate students and sessional instructors, who are often underpaid and lack institutional support. The author believes that if writing were truly valued, more time and resources would be devoted to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Problem with ChatGPT</strong>: The author criticizes the use of ChatGPT for writing assignments, stating that the essays it produces are superficial and lack depth. The author suggests that the problem isn&#39;t with ChatGPT itself, but with the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. Students have been trained to write in a formulaic manner, which is why AI can mimic this style.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching Writing at Scale</strong>: The author asserts that good writing instruction cannot be scaled up. It requires small classes, time, professional development, and integration across the curriculum. The author criticizes solutions that try to address the ChatGPT problem without acknowledging this fact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity vs. Academic Integrity</strong>: The author distinguishes between academic integrity and assessment integrity. The author argues that the issue with ChatGPT is not an academic integrity issue, but an assessment integrity issue. The focus should be on improving the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI Detection and Surveillance</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection, such as Turnitin&#39;s efforts to add AI detection to their originality checker. The author argues that these are not effective solutions and only contribute to an arms race.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advice for Teachers</strong>: The author suggests that teachers should talk to students about ChatGPT and its shortcomings, evaluate for process rather than product, include reflection in assessments, and think critically about their assessments. The author advises against ramping up surveillance, banning ChatGPT, or giving up on essay writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Future</strong>: The author warns that if the current issues are not addressed, the next step could be AI marking AI essays. The author calls for more hands-on writing instruction, smaller classes, authentic assessment, relationship building, and care. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>More succinct summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> If you were to summarize your previous response into two key points, what would it be?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity and Teaching Approach</strong>: The blog post emphasizes the need for a shift in the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. It argues that the issue with AI-generated essays isn&#39;t about academic integrity but assessment integrity. The focus should be on the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI and Pedagogical Solutions</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection and advises against banning AI tools like ChatGPT. Instead, the author suggests that educators should engage students in discussions about AI&#39;s role and shortcomings in writing, evaluate the process of writing rather than just the product, and include reflection in assessments. </p></li>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> June 1, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you read this article and provide a summary...focusing on this area...How AI used in education today (or at the time of publication of this article)....What areas, teaching, learning, admin, it, automation...etc...Here is the article: https://michaelwhyte.github.io/research/article.pdf</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>The article titled &quot;Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Review&quot; provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on various aspects of education. It focuses on three main areas: administration, instruction, and learning.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Administration</strong>: AI has been adopted extensively in educational institutions, particularly in administrative functions. It has made tasks such as reviewing and grading students&#39; assignments more efficient and effective. This has resulted in higher quality in teaching activities. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instruction</strong>: AI has been used to perform instructors’ duties independently or with instructors. This includes the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots. AI has also been embedded into robots to improve the learning experience of students, from early childhood education. Cobots, or robots working together with teachers, are being applied to teach children routine tasks, including spelling and pronunciation, and adjusting to the students’ abilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning</strong>: AI systems leverage machine learning and adaptability to customize and personalize curriculum and content in line with students’ needs. This has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners&#39; experience and overall quality of learning. AI has also been incorporated into web-based and online education systems that learn instructor and learner behavior to adjust accordingly, enriching the educational experience.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The article also discusses the nature of AI, defining it as a field of study and a theory. As a field, AI is a study area in computer science whose pursuits are aimed at solving different cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition. As a theory, AI is a theoretical framework guiding the development and use of computer systems with the capabilities of human beings, more particularly, intelligence and the ability to perform tasks that require human intelligence.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article suggests that AI has fostered effectiveness and efficiency in the performance of administrative tasks in education, and overall fostered improved instructional and learning effectiveness in education.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you read the same article and provide a summary of its contents...</p>
