<h2 id="toc_0">Prototype</h2>

<p>the forth in the design thinking process is prototype and that is where we make some form of what it is that we&#39;re trying to put out for our users humans clients customers so it&#39;s basically a mock-up of what it is that we want to make and impro typing well the reason that we&#39;re doing this is we want to explore to make sure that the problem we have identified the problem we have ideated on and the problem that we have tried to solve with our prototype is actually the right problem so in creating a physical mock-up a wireframe a low fidelity mock-up a paper prototype a book dummy whatever it is that we&#39;re designing we want to explore how this thing is working or not working we want to inspire our users or our colleagues and collaborators by putting something in their hands so you&#39;ve often seen these like cardboard mock-ups from the first Mouse the first computer mouse that was ever created we want to inspire people to find out and collect more data about what is working and what is not working and a prototype in whatever form it takes is a chance to have a conversation to talk about what this thing is and if it&#39;s meeting the needs and creating the feelings in the humans that we are designing for so some of the things that we need to keep in mind and embrace in this phase of the process is one failure they&#39;re going to be things that don&#39;t work they&#39;re going to be things that we need to just trash completely and we need to be comfortable with that because the more we can release and let go and move on to a new idea or a new design the faster the better the product will be in the end iteration it&#39;s multiple attempts there&#39;s no such thing as one of something we&#39;re always produced many versions many variations and we call that iteration that is part of this process and then the third thing that we want to keep in mind is what we learn from the prototype may mean that we need to revisit empathy define id8 we may need to revisit some of the previous phases so we want to keep those things in mind now some of the forms that prototypes can take and depending on whether we&#39;re designing for mobile applications or we&#39;re designing for services or we&#39;re designing a public service announcement a PSA an animation we may be creating paper prototypes those are actually still very useful for websites in mobile applications animatics in the terms of motion graphics or animations we need to test and make sure that the movement and the story that we&#39;re trying to tell is effective comps that really stands for comprehensives so if it&#39;s brochures if it&#39;s printed matter if it&#39;s branding then we need to key then we need to create comprehensive of what these final products will look look like and that brings me to low fidelity and high fidelity especially mobile application design for example we might start out with low fidelity paper prototypes test those with users and then take them to higher fidelity until they&#39;re actual high functioning high fidelity prototypes that we&#39;re delivering through a prototype service or is actually being developed with the backend code wireframes are a form of prototyping walkthroughs if it&#39;s service design and we&#39;re creating a new service to be delivered let&#39;s go to back to that TSA example if we&#39;re trying to explore how we can redesign that process we might do walkthroughs actual tests of whether this process will actually work and that is also maquettes if it&#39;s a point of purchase it variants that we&#39;re creating we might create a mock-up of that port point-of-purchase design so this is prototyping </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Why Prototype</h2>

<p>the reason that we&#39;re doing this is we want to explore to make sure that the problem we have identified the problem we have ideated on and the problem that we have tried to solve with our prototype is actually the right problem so in creating a physical mock-up a wireframe a low fidelity mock-up a paper prototype a book dummy whatever it is that we&#39;re designing we want to explore how this thing is working or not working we want to inspire our users or our colleagues and collaborators by putting something in their hands so you&#39;ve often seen these like cardboard mock-ups from the first Mouse the first computer mouse that was ever created we want to inspire people to find out and collect more data about what is working and what is not working and a prototype in whatever form it takes is a chance to have a conversation to talk about what this thing is and if it&#39;s meeting the needs and creating the feelings in the humans that we are designing for so some of the things that we need to keep in mind and embrace in this phase of the process is one failure they&#39;re going to be things that don&#39;t work they&#39;re going to be things that we need to just trash completely and we need to be comfortable with that because the more we can release and let go and move on to a new idea or a new design the faster the better the product will be in the end iteration it&#39;s multiple attempts there&#39;s no such thing as one of something we&#39;re always produced many versions many variations and we call that iteration that is part of this process and then the third thing that we want to keep in mind is what we learn from the prototype may mean that we need to revisit empathy define id8 we may need to revisit some of the previous phases so we want to keep those things in mind now some of the forms that prototypes can take and depending on whether we&#39;re designing for mobile applications or we&#39;re designing for services or we&#39;re designing a public service announcement a PSA an animation we may be creating paper prototypes those are actually still very useful for websites in mobile applications animatics in the terms of motion graphics or animations we need to test and make sure that the movement and the story that we&#39;re trying to tell is effective comps that really stands for comprehensives so if it&#39;s brochures if it&#39;s printed matter if it&#39;s branding then we need to key then we need to create comprehensive of what these final products will look look like and that brings me to low fidelity and high fidelity especially mobile application design for example we might start out with low fidelity paper prototypes test those with users and then take them to higher fidelity until they&#39;re actual high functioning high fidelity prototypes that we&#39;re delivering through a prototype service or is actually being developed with the backend code wireframes are a form of prototyping walkthroughs if it&#39;s service design and we&#39;re creating a new service to be delivered let&#39;s go to back to that TSA example if we&#39;re trying to explore how we can redesign that process we might do walkthroughs actual tests of whether this process will actually work and that is also maquettes if it&#39;s a point of purchase it variants that we&#39;re creating we might create a mock-up of that port point-of-purchase design so this is prototyping </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Things to keep in mind</h2>

<p>things that we need to keep in mind and embrace in this phase of the process is one failure they&#39;re going to be things that don&#39;t work they&#39;re going to be things that we need to just trash completely and we need to be comfortable with that because the more we can release and let go and move on to a new idea or a new design the faster the better the product will be in the end iteration it&#39;s multiple attempts there&#39;s no such thing as one of something we&#39;re always produced many versions many variations and we call that iteration that is part of this process and then the third thing that we want to keep in mind is what we learn from the prototype may mean that we need to revisit empathy define id8 we may need to revisit some of the previous phases so we want to keep those things in mind now some of the forms that prototypes can take and depending on whether we&#39;re designing for mobile applications or we&#39;re designing for services or we&#39;re designing a public service announcement a PSA an animation we may be creating paper prototypes those are actually still very useful for websites in mobile applications animatics in the terms of motion graphics or animations we need to test and make sure that the movement and the story that we&#39;re trying to tell is effective comps that really stands for comprehensives so if it&#39;s brochures if it&#39;s printed matter if it&#39;s branding then we need to key then we need to create comprehensive of what these final products will look look like and that brings me to low fidelity and high fidelity especially mobile application design for example we might start out with low fidelity paper prototypes test those with users and then take them to higher fidelity until they&#39;re actual high functioning high fidelity prototypes that we&#39;re delivering through a prototype service or is actually being developed with the backend code wireframes are a form of prototyping walkthroughs if it&#39;s service design and we&#39;re creating a new service to be delivered let&#39;s go to back to that TSA example if we&#39;re trying to explore how we can redesign that process we might do walkthroughs actual tests of whether this process will actually work and that is also maquettes if it&#39;s a point of purchase it variants that we&#39;re creating we might create a mock-up of that port point-of-purchase design so this is prototyping </p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Prototype forms</h2>

<p>that prototypes can take and depending on whether we&#39;re designing for mobile applications or we&#39;re designing for services or we&#39;re designing a public service announcement a PSA an animation we may be creating paper prototypes those are actually still very useful for websites in mobile applications animatics in the terms of motion graphics or animations we need to test and make sure that the movement and the story that we&#39;re trying to tell is effective comps that really stands for comprehensives so if it&#39;s brochures if it&#39;s printed matter if it&#39;s branding then we need to key then we need to create comprehensive of what these final products will look look like and that brings me to low fidelity and high fidelity especially mobile application design for example we might start out with low fidelity paper prototypes test those with users and then take them to higher fidelity until they&#39;re actual high functioning high fidelity prototypes that we&#39;re delivering through a prototype service or is actually being developed with the backend code wireframes are a form of prototyping walkthroughs if it&#39;s service design and we&#39;re creating a new service to be delivered let&#39;s go to back to that TSA example if we&#39;re trying to explore how we can redesign that process we might do walkthroughs actual tests of whether this process will actually work and that is also maquettes if it&#39;s a point of purchase it variants that we&#39;re creating we might create a mock-up of that port point-of-purchase design so this is prototyping </p>
