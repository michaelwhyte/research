<h2 id="toc_1">Authentic Assessment Description</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are many ways to talk about authentic assessment, but the essence of this approach is that it is, in fact, authentic </li>
</ul>

<p>This means that a physics assessment should involve doing physics -- performing experiments and solving problems the same way that a real-life physicist would. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>An authentic history assessment requires students to ask questions, do independent research, and formulate answers to their questions, just like a real-life historian does.</p></li>
<li><p>The above ...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">What Can Authentic Assessments Do</h2>

<p>What else does authentic assessment do?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It engages students and is based in content or media in which the students actually have a genuine interest.</p></li>
<li><p>It asks students to synthesize information and use critical-thinking skills.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a learning experience in and of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>It measures not just what students remember but how they think.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps students understand where they are academically and helps teachers know how to best teach them.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">More Thoughts on Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Authentic assessment is front-loaded for teachers...</p></li>
<li><p>...but according to SOF learning specialist Whitney Lukens, &quot;It makes teaching more efficient and really speeds things up.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>Because you always know where your students are in the learning process, you can be much more directed in your teaching... </p></li>
<li><p>You avoid wasting time teaching students what they already know or aren&#39;t yet ready to learn. </p></li>
<li><p>It also means you&#39;re a lot less likely to reach the end of a unit only to discover what your students didn&#39;t learn.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_5">Key Quote on Effectiveness of Project Based Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li>One of the things that is interesting why project-based
learning is important to applied is indicated by some of the
research that preceded it. The results showed that 90% of the
students who follow the learning process with the
implementation of project-based learning is confident and
optimistic can implement project-based learning in the world
of work as well as academic achievement can increase [1].
In addition the research results of the survey, [2] showed
78% of students said that the curriculum based on projectbased learning can help equip learners to prepare for
entering the world of work, because students learn not just in
theory but of practice in the field.</li>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize the article at the url shown into a few succinct bullet points located at this. Here is the URL: http://repository.unp.ac.id/27250/1/6%20Review%20Project%20Based%20Learning.pdf</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I lost the initial response, and I had to run the prompt again. I am not sure if the second response was the same as the first response...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Here are the key points from the article titled &quot;Review Project Based Learning&quot; published in the International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The article is a systematic review of primary research articles published between December 2006 and November 2014 that focused on project-based learning (PBL).</p></li>
<li><p>PBL is an innovative instructional approach that emphasizes contextual learning through complex activities. It focuses on the main concepts and principles of a discipline, involving students in problem-solving activities and other meaningful tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>PBL has been shown to enable students to become interactive learners and to construct knowledge through exploration. It has proven particularly effective when combined with computer technology.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of technology in PBL can be categorized as technology-supported or multimedia technology-assisted. In technology-supported PBL, technologies are often used as communication tools, research tools, scaffolding tools, project management tools, and telecollaboration tools.</p></li>
<li><p>PBL is seen as a learning strategy that is developed based on constructivist learning schools demanding learners to construct their own knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>The article also discusses the potential barriers to multimedia technology-assisted PBL projects, including technical difficulties with software, hardware, and networks, as well as time constraints and the need for teacher training.</p></li>
<li><p>The article concludes that PBL is an effective educational approach that focuses on creative thinking, problem-solving, and the interaction of the students with their peers to create and use new knowledge. It is particularly effective in the context of active learning, scientific dialogue with supervisors who are active as researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>The review also suggests that PBL has a great potential to create learning experiences that are interesting and meaningful for students to enter employment. It helps learners to have the creativity of thinking, problem-solving, and interactions as well as aiding in the investigation that leads to the completion of real issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The review also highlights the need for further research related to PBL to continue to refine and understand its effectiveness in various learning contexts.</p></li>

<li><p>&quot;...Engaging and worthy problems or questions of importance, in which students must use knowledge to fashion performances effectively and creatively. The tasks are either replicas of or analogous to the kinds of problems faced by adult citizens and consumers or professionals in the field.&quot; - Grant Wiggins (Wiggins, 1993, p. 229)</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_10">Description of Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li>An authentic assessment usually includes a task for students to perform and a rubric by which their performance on the task will be evaluated...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_11">Authentic Assessments vs Traditional Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>By &quot;traditional assessment&quot; (TA) I am referring to the forced-choice measures of multiple-choice tests, fill-in-the-blanks, true-false, matching and the like that have been and remain so common in education.  Students typically select an answer or recall information to complete the assessment. These tests may be standardized or teacher-created.  They may be administered locally or statewide, or internationally...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Behind traditional and authentic assessments is a belief that the primary mission of schools is to help develop productive citizens...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_12">Tradional Assessments Reasoning</h3>

<p>Essentially, TA is grounded in educational philosophy that adopts the following reasoning and practice:</p>

<ol>
<li>A school&#39;s mission is to develop productive citizens.</li>
<li>To be a productive citizen an individual must possess a certain body of knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Therefore, schools must teach this body of knowledge and skills.</li>
<li><p>To determine if it is successful, the school must then test students to see if they acquired the knowledge and skills.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>The above is a ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>In the TA model, the curriculum drives assessment.   &quot;The&quot; body of knowledge is determined first.  That knowledge becomes the curriculum that is delivered.  Subsequently, the assessments are developed and administered to determine if acquisition of the curriculum occurred...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_13">Authentic Assessment Reasoning</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>...authentic assessment (AA) springs from the following reasoning and practice:</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>A school&#39;s mission is to develop productive citizens.</li>
<li>To be a productive citizen, an individual must be capable of performing meaningful tasks in the real world.</li>
<li>Therefore, schools must help students become proficient at performing the tasks they will encounter when they graduate.</li>
<li><p>To determine if it is successful, the school must then ask students to perform meaningful tasks that replicate real world challenges to see if students are capable of doing so.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>The above is a ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>...in AA, assessment drives the curriculum.  That is, teachers first determine the tasks that students will perform to demonstrate their mastery, and then a curriculum is developed that will enable students to perform those tasks well, which would include the acquisition of essential knowledge and skills...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Good example here:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If I were a golf instructor and I taught the skills required to perform well, I would not assess my students&#39; performance by giving them a multiple choice test.  I would put them out on the golf course and ask them to perform...DQ...</li>

<ul>
<li><p>...a teacher does not have to choose between AA and TA. </p></li>
<li><p>It is likely that some mix of the two will best meet your needs. </p></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I had to choose a chauffeur from between someone who passed the driving portion of the driver&#39;s license test but failed the written portion or someone who failed the driving portion and passed the written portion, I would choose the driver who most directly demonstrated the ability to drive, that is, the one who passed the driving portion of the test. However, I would prefer a driver who passed both portions. I would feel more comfortable knowing that my chauffeur had a good knowledge base about driving (which might best be assessed in a traditional manner) and was able to apply that knowledge in a real context (which could be demonstrated through an authentic assessment)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="toc_16">Teaching to the Test</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TA Model:</strong> Teaching to the test is discouraged. Tests assess a sample of knowledge, assuming it represents overall understanding. Focusing solely on the test sample may not reflect knowledge of all material, so teachers hide the test and avoid teaching to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AA Model:</strong> Teaching to the test is encouraged. Students need to perform well on meaningful tasks. Showing models of good performance and providing task rubrics in advance helps students develop the necessary skills. Authentic assessments don&#39;t lend themselves to mimicry as there isn&#39;t one correct answer to copy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AA Benefits:</strong> Knowing what good performance looks like and understanding the specific characteristics helps students develop skills and understanding to perform well on tasks.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_19">Authentic Assessments are Direct Measures</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Authentic assessments provide direct measures of students&#39; ability to apply acquired knowledge and skills in real-world situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional assessments, such as tests of knowledge, offer indirect evidence of the ability to apply knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct, authentic evidence can be obtained by asking students to use what they have learned in meaningful ways, similar to how a golf student is assessed by playing on a golf course.</p></li>
<li><p>Professions like doctors, electricians, teachers, and actors require direct demonstration of relevant skills for employment, going beyond written or oral tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, before declaring students ready to graduate, pass a course, or move on to the next grade, it is valuable to ask for direct evidence of their competence.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_20">Authentic Assessments Capture Constructive Nature of Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Research on learning suggests that we don&#39;t simply absorb knowledge; instead, we construct our own understanding of the world using information, experiences, and teachings.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Bransford &amp; Vye, 1989; Forman &amp; Kuschner, 1977; Neisser, 1967; Steffe &amp; Gale, 1995; Wittrock, 1991)

<ul>
<li>See website for reference links</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assessments should go beyond asking students to regurgitate information and instead focus on assessing whether they have accurately constructed meaning from what they have been taught.</p></li>
<li><p>Students should have the opportunity to actively engage in the construction of meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic tasks not only serve as assessments but also facilitate meaningful learning by allowing students to apply their constructed understanding.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_21">Authentic Assessments Integrate Teaching, Learning and Assessment</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Authentic assessment integrates teaching, learning, and assessing, while traditional assessment often separates them.</p></li>
<li><p>In traditional assessment, knowledge or skills are acquired first, and then a test is administered. In authentic assessment, the same task used for assessment is also a vehicle for student learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic assessment involves presenting real-world problems for students to solve, allowing them to learn while developing solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Teachers facilitate the learning process during authentic assessment, and students&#39; solutions become an assessment of their ability to apply concepts meaningfully.</p></li>

<p><strong>GOOD POINT ON THE DISADVANTAGE OF TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>...testing favors those who are better test-takers and does not give students any choice in how they believe they can best demonstrate what they have learned...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>Individuals have different learning strengths and weaknesses, as well as different ways to demonstrate their learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional assessments, such as multiple-choice questions, limit the variability in how students can showcase their knowledge and skills.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended to use multiple and varied assessments to obtain an adequate number of samples and employ a variety of measurement approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Using different assessment measures allows students to apply their learning in diverse ways and from various perspectives.
Authentic tasks provide students with more freedom to demonstrate their learning in ways that suit them best.</p></li>
<li><p>By establishing clear performance criteria in advance, teachers can compare student performance even when expressed differently.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic tasks can result in different forms of student products (posters, oral presentations, videos, websites) or allow for varied modes of expression within a single product.
This approach allows for variation while still assessing the common set of skills required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, essay questions are constructed-response items. That is, in response to a prompt, students construct an answer out of old and new knowledge. Since there is no one exact answer to these prompts, students are constructing new knowledge that likely differs slightly or significantly from that constructed by other students...DQ...</p>

<li>MW here...The phrase the author uses &quot;in response to a prompt&quot;...is exactly how we interact with an AI LLM...We use a prompt and it replies based on knowledge avaliable to the AI&#39;s dataset...It may not construct new knowledge but may give the appearance of sythesized knowledge as it is using knowledge from the a very large dataset made up of thousands if not millions of human authors of papers and websites on a subject...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>...explaining or analyzing as one might do in an essay answer replicates a real-world skill one frequently uses...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>MW here...Since AI LLM&#39;s can replicate this skill quite easily in written form, having students demonstrate this skill using live mediums such as interactive presentations, debates or interviews where students have to think on there feet and understand the information may be more effective way to demonstrate that they have achieved the learning objectives of an assessment...

<h2 id="toc_31">Good Point on Why Authentic Assessment is Important</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the learners are to be made ready to deal with ambiguous real-life problems, then they have to be able to demonstrate higher- order thinking abilities...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_32">Alternative Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Alternative assessment is a different approach to evaluating students&#39; learning compared to traditional tests. It focuses on motivating and inspiring students to explore and use their critical thinking and creativity. While traditional tests mainly measure how well students remember facts, alternative assessment looks at their long-term retention of knowledge and their ability to apply it in real-life situations.</p></li>
<li><p>One major approach in alternative assessment is <strong><em>authentic assessment</em></strong>, which has two key concepts: performance and authenticity. Performance means students demonstrate their knowledge or skills through observable actions or responses. Authenticity refers to tasks that resemble real-world challenges. These tasks require students to think critically and use higher-order thinking skills to solve problems they might encounter in the real world.</p></li>
<li><p>Another technique within alternative assessment is the use of <strong><em>portfolios</em></strong>. Portfolios are collections of students&#39; work that show their progress and mastery of skills in a particular subject. They are goal-oriented and emphasize the construction of knowledge throughout the learning process. Portfolios provide an authentic experience and encourage problem-solving approaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Projects</em></strong> are also part of alternative assessment. They involve students working on a goal-oriented task, such as developing a plan, conducting research, or creating artwork. Projects require students to use their own skills and strategies to solve a problem. However, projects require more responsibility from students and more time and effort from teachers to evaluate the diverse products students create.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, alternative assessment provides different ways for teachers to understand students&#39; strengths and weaknesses by focusing on their real-life application of knowledge and skills. It involves performance tasks, authentic challenges, portfolios, and projects to assess students&#39; learning in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_33">Traditional versus Alternative Assessment</h2>

<p>Language testing is an important part of education, but there are concerns about its effectiveness. Critics argue that traditional tests like multiple choice, true-false, fill-in-the-blanks, and matching exercises are not suitable for measuring language learning. These tests provide limited information about the learning process and lack real-world relevance. They may test basic understanding or vocabulary but not other important language skills.</p>

<p>Traditional tests are often seen as one-time, norm-referenced, and speed-based assessments that don&#39;t give a comprehensive picture of a student&#39;s progress or difficulties. They also fail to capture important aspects like students&#39; motivations, interests, and learning strategies. Standardized tests, in particular, have negative effects on the curriculum, teaching methods, and students&#39; psychological well-being. They narrow the focus of education to what is tested, encourage rote memorization, and disregard individual interests and efforts.</p>

<p>Interest groups have called for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive approach to assessment to ensure fairness and excellence for all students. This has led to a shift towards alternative assessment methods. Alternative assessment emphasizes authentic procedures and techniques that can be integrated into everyday classroom activities. It allows students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in different ways and provides a more comprehensive evaluation of their learning, achievements, motivations, and attitudes. This form of assessment is considered beneficial for both instruction and learning progress.</p>

<p>In summary, traditional tests have limitations in measuring language learning, and alternative assessment methods offer more authentic and inclusive ways to evaluate students&#39; progress and enhance the educational process.</p>

<h3 id="toc_36">Disadvantages of Alternative Assessments</h3>

<p>Ok...Interesting conversation (or prompt - response session) with ChatGPT where I asked the AI-LLM to summarize the disadvantage section, and clarify a section and then asked if my understanding was correct...below is the prompt response conversation...It ends with the AI summarizing my own explanation of my understanding (based on the AI&#39;s summary of the author of the articles text) of the disadvantages of alternative assessments...</p>

<p>Here is the prompt - response session...</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Based on the text that is included after this question...can you summarize a few disadvantages of alternative assessments...Here is the text to base that quesion on...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Based on the provided text, here are a few disadvantages of alternative assessments:</p>

<p>Alternative assessments can be more time-consuming and costly for teachers to analyze and provide accurate feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Implementing different methods of alternative assessment successfully requires skillful teachers.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners may need more guidance and supervision to adapt to alternative assessment practices, especially if they are accustomed to traditional methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Alternative assessment may face challenges in terms of psychometric qualities such as validity, reliability, and practicality.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>MW...I had difficulty understanding this bullet point, so I asked for an explanation of it...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are doubts about the feasibility of applying alternative assessment to large-scale classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Some caution that authentic assessment may become unrealistic through impractical tasks, leading to limitations in its application.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to consider the limitations and pitfalls of any assessment method, rather than relying solely on a single strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>The choice of assessment techniques, timing, and the individuals involved in the assessment process should be carefully considered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These disadvantages highlight concerns related to time, cost, teacher expertise, student adaptation, psychometric qualities, scalability, and potential limitations in the practicality and realism of alternative assessment methods. </p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you explain this line...&quot;Alternative assessment may face challenges in terms of psychometric qualities such as validity, reliability, and practicality&quot;...specifically &quot;psychometric&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Certainly! In the context of assessment, &quot;psychometric&quot; refers to the measurement properties or characteristics of an assessment method or tool. It focuses on the reliability, validity, and practicality of the assessment. Let&#39;s break down what these terms mean in relation to psychometrics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Validity:</strong> Validity refers to the extent to which an assessment measures what it intends to measure. In alternative assessment, ensuring the validity means accurately assessing the intended learning outcomes or skills without bias or distortion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Reliability refers to the consistency and stability of assessment results. In other words, if the same assessment is administered multiple times, it should yield consistent results. Reliability in alternative assessment means that the assessment is dependable and produces consistent outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practicality:</strong> Practicality refers to the feasibility and usability of an assessment method in real-world contexts. In alternative assessment, practicality refers to the ease of administration, scoring, and interpretation of the assessment, as well as the time and resources required.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The line you mentioned suggests that alternative assessments may face challenges in terms of meeting the psychometric requirements of validity, reliability, and practicality. These challenges may arise due to the unique nature of alternative assessment methods and the need to carefully design and implement them to ensure accurate and consistent measurement of learning outcomes while considering practical constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Ok I think I get it...Is this kind of what you mean...Basically the line means that alternative assessments can be challenging because the product to be assessed can be variable so reducing bias or other distortions is difficult...It can be less reliable since again the assessed product can be quite varied so running the assessment a second or third time may result in variable grades or assessments...and thirdly...Alternative assessments can be expensive (in time and resources) to implement making them less practical...Is this sort of correct?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you&#39;ve captured the main points accurately! Here&#39;s a summarized explanation based on your understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Alternative assessments can be challenging because the nature of what is being assessed (the product) can vary widely. This variability makes it difficult to reduce biases or distortions in the assessment process, affecting the validity of the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Since alternative assessments often involve diverse tasks or projects, repeating the assessment multiple times may yield different grades or assessments due to the inherent variability. This can impact the reliability of the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, alternative assessments can be more resource-intensive and time-consuming to implement compared to traditional assessments, making them less practical in certain contexts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, alternative assessments face challenges in terms of validity, reliability, and practicality due to the variability of the assessed product, potential inconsistencies in repeated assessments, and the resources required for implementation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_39">Definition of Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Authentic assessments are assignments that ask students to answer essential questions in your discipline and use concepts as professionals in the field would...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Marilla Svinicki suggests that authentic assignments should be based on “student activities that replicate real world performances as closely as possible” (2004, p. 23)</p>

<ul>
<li>Use as cited in...if you are going to use this one...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_40">Description of What are Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Unlike traditional assessments, authentic assessments foster disciplinary behaviours and ways of thinking and problem solving used by professionals in the field...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>For example, authentic assessments in engineering would demonstrate students’ increasing ability to think and problem-solve in ways that resembles how experts in the engineering field think and act</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assignments are and can only be authentic when they meaningfully connect with students beyond the assigned grade at the end of their obligatory participation in the project (Frey, Schmitt &amp; Allen, 2012). Finding and celebrating that value for students, past the grade appearing on their transcripts, is vital to authentic education...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_41">Characteristics of Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Resemble real-world tasks and activities</p></li>
<li><p>Can be structured as written or oral assessments completed individually, in pairs, or in groups</p></li>
<li><p>Often presented as ill-structured problems with no right answers</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to communicate their knowledge orally or in writing to a specific audience and for specific purpose</p></li>
<li><p>Usually ask students to address professional or lay audiences</p></li>
<li><p>The above bullet points are ...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_42">Authentic Assessment Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="toc_43">1. Memos, Letters to the Editor and E-mails</h3>

<p>This type of assignment asks students to write from the first-person singular perspective of an historical individual, an imagined individual, or themselves for the purpose of developing a coherent thread of knowledge for an intended/imagined audience. This type of project encourages students to use their imaginations but also to research and collate an explicit and tangible body of knowledge in their discipline while at the same time developing critical and professional written and communication skills.</p>

<p>For example, students in Finance might be asked to write a client memo; students in Recreation and Leisure Studies might be asked to write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper about a community concern; and students in Visual Culture might be asked to write an e-mail to an imagined manager about a magazine cover they are currently designing.</p>

<h3 id="toc_44">2. Presentations (incl. Poster Presentations)</h3>

<p>Presentations are the most readily approachable method of authentic assessment for both students and teachers. The idea of having students take their work and make it public within the context of the classroom not only encourages students to invest more time and thought into their work but also immediately connects to the development of professional skills and of presentation skills for a variety of audiences. Key aspects that make presentations authentic are the rehearsal and preparation time required to succeed, the practice and development of an appropriate, polished use of PowerPoint and/or other visual aids and representations, the growth of working either individually or collaboratively, as well as the improvement of posture, gesture, and vocal variety all while enhancing professional verbal, visual, written communication skills.</p>

<p>For example, students in Chemistry might present on how to balance a simple combustion reaction; students in Rhetoric might present a major research paper; and students in Mechanical Engineering might present a unit manufacturing process of ceramic casting.</p>

<h3 id="toc_45">3. Proposals, Policy Briefs and Reports</h3>

<p>A proposal for a larger, longer, and/or more heavily weighted project offers students the opportunity to try on and out their ideas and set their own goals for their learning before executing the final project. A policy brief and/or report asks students to address in a professional manner – for which the intended audience is other professionals interested in the problem, investigation, research, etc. – a research question, course of action, decision, theory, etc. that is of interest and importance. This type of assignment also familiarizes students with the genre and language of the proposal, the policy brief, and/or the report for the professional field following their education.</p>

<p>For example, students in Psychology might write a proposal for an experimental study; students in Applied Mathematics write a policy report of ethical navigation of stock option prices and students in Biology might write a report on their own dietary analysis.</p>

<h3 id="toc_46">4. Case Studies and Simulation Games</h3>

<p>Case studies present a fictional scenario that leads up to one (or more) dilemma that requires problem solving or decision-making. When in-class time, however, can be given over for students to act out these case studies, with different students playing different assigned roles from the fictional scenarios, the case study then becomes a simulation game (Bean 1996). Common simulation games, Bean notes, are “mock trials, mock city council or legislative meetings, and mock meetings of corporation stockholders or school boards” that all leverage to make the case studies more authentic. Bean further notes that the simulation assignment usually would include background information and data from the problem to be solved as well as biographical synopses for each of the roles the students will play (p. 180).</p>

<p>For example, students in Pharmacy might enact a simulation game of a case study on drug information and patient safety; students in Peace and Conflict Studies might take on a simulation game of a case study involving international development; and students in Nanotechnology might present a simulation game of a case study concerning the testing of environmental pollutants.</p>

<h3 id="toc_47">5. Fishbowls</h3>

<p>In a fishbowl assignment, small numbers of students are picked to sit the “hot seats” in the centre of class where they respond to questions, concerns, ideas, etc. about subject matter that will have been passed out prior to the fishbowl activity date. The remainder of the class sits around the hot seated students to form the perimeter of the fishbowl, and the engage with the prepared participants to advance further their knowledge and comprehension of the subject material. This assessment strategy is a variation of the flipped-classroom teaching method, and it develops in students professional skillsets for active listening and critical inquiry as well as professional communication, presentation, and group discussion skills.</p>

<p>For example, students in Sexuality, Marriage, and Family Studies might prepare for and discuss issues of surrogate motherhood; students in Earth and Space Science might prepare for and discuss methods of instrumentation and observation of different wavelengths; and students in Acrylic Painting prepare for and discuss innovative application techniques and mark-making.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What is authentic assessment and how does it differ from traditional assessment methods</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Authentic assessment is a method of evaluating student performance on intellectual tasks that are directly related to real-world challenges. It involves assessing students&#39; abilities to apply acquired knowledge and skills to solve complex problems, conduct research, write and revise papers, engage in discussions, and collaborate with others. Authentic assessment emphasizes the use of open-ended questions and tasks that require students to craft polished, thorough, and justifiable answers, performances, or products. It also standardizes the appropriate criteria for scoring such varied products to achieve validity and reliability.</p>

<p>In contrast, traditional assessment methods rely on indirect or proxy &#39;items&#39; that are efficient, simplistic substitutes from which valid inferences can be made about the student&#39;s performance at those valued challenges. Traditional assessments tend to reveal only whether the student can recognize, recall, or &quot;plug in&quot; what was learned out of context. They are usually limited to paper-and-pencil, one-answer questions that assess static and too-often arbitrarily discrete or simplistic elements of those activities. Traditional tests typically only ask the student to select or write correct responses irrespective of reasons, and they standardize objective &quot;items&quot; and, hence, the (one) right answer for each.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What are the benefits of using authentic assessment in education</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Authentic assessment in education has several benefits. It allows for direct examination of student performance on intellectual tasks, rather than relying on indirect or proxy items. It requires students to be effective performers with acquired knowledge, rather than just recognizing or recalling information out of context. It presents students with a full array of tasks that mirror the priorities and challenges found in the best instructional activities, rather than limiting them to paper-and-pencil, one-answer questions. </p>

<p>It attends to whether the student can craft polished, thorough, and justifiable answers, performances, or products, rather than just selecting or writing correct responses. Authentic assessment achieves validity and reliability by emphasizing and standardizing the appropriate criteria for scoring such varied products, rather than standardizing objective &quot;items&quot; and the one right answer for each. Authentic tasks involve &quot;ill-structured&quot; challenges and roles that help students rehearse for the complex ambiguities of the &quot;game&quot; of adult and professional life, rather than assessing static and too-often arbitrarily discrete or simplistic elements of those activities. Finally, authentic assessment primarily supports the needs of learners, allowing for greater clarity about their obligations and more engaging tasks, and is useful for improving instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you list two benefits of authentic assessments?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Two benefits of using authentic assessment in education are that it directly examines student performance on worthy intellectual tasks and provides parents and community members with directly observable products and understandable evidence concerning their students&#39; performance.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Did the author raise concerns about the cost of authentic assessments...If so how did he address them?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Yes, the author of the article on authentic assessment did address concerns about its cost. The author argued that while the scoring of judgment-based tasks may seem expensive when compared to multiple-choice tests, the gains to teacher professional development, local assessing, and student learning are many. The author also pointed out that significant improvements occur locally in the teaching and assessing of writing and science when teachers become involved and invested in the scoring process. Additionally, the author suggested that sampling may be the appropriate response if costs prove prohibitive, and that valuable information can be gained at a minimum cost through various sampling strategies.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lev Vygotsky&#39;s (1896-1934) theory of social constructivism emphasized the importance of sociocultural learning; how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized by learners to form mental constructs through the zone of proximal development. </p></li>
<li><p>Expanding upon Vygotsky&#39;s theory Jerome Bruner and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of instructional scaffolding, whereby the social or informational environment offers supports (or scaffolds) for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.</p></li>
<li><p>Above summarized...</p></li>
<li><p>Lev Vygotsky&#39;s theory: Emphasizes sociocultural learning and the internalization of interactions with adults, capable peers, and cognitive tools, shaping mental constructs through the zone of proximal development.</p></li>
<li><p>Jerome Bruner&#39;s concept of instructional scaffolding: Provides gradual support in the social or informational environment for learning, gradually withdrawing support as learners internalize knowledge and skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Summarized at a grade 10 level...</p></li>
<li><p>Lev Vygotsky&#39;s theory says that we learn from interacting with others, like adults and peers. We also learn from using tools that help our thinking. These interactions and tools shape how we understand things and form ideas in our minds.</p></li>
<li><p>Jerome Bruner&#39;s idea of instructional scaffolding means that when we learn something new, we get support from our surroundings, like teachers or information. This support is gradually reduced as we get better at the task. It helps us bridge the gap between what we can do now and what we can eventually do on our own.</p></li>

<li><p>When individuals assimilate new information, they incorporate it into an already existing framework without changing that framework...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>When we learn new things, we usually fit them into what we already know without changing our existing understanding. This happens when our experiences match what we already believe about the world. Sometimes, though, we might not notice certain things, misunderstand what others are saying, or think that something unusual is just a random event and not important information.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, when our experiences don&#39;t match what we already believe, we might change our understanding to make it fit. We adjust our perceptions to match what we already think is true.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_53">Accomodation</h2>

<ul>
<li>According to the theory, accommodation is the process of reframing one&#39;s mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others&#39; failure...DQ...</li>

<li><p>Some people criticize this approach, saying that &quot;learning by doing&quot; may not be the best instructional strategy.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_55">Social Constructivism</h2>

<h2 id="toc_56">Responsibility for Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li>Responsibility falls more to the student as opposed to the instructor as with previous viewpoints...Paraphrased Wikipedia...</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Social constructivism says that students should take more responsibility for their own learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional viewpoints where teachers did all the teaching and students just listened, social constructivism emphasizes that students need to be actively involved in the learning process.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>KEY IDEA</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Michael Whyte</p>

<ul>
<li>Since AI can parrot information on any topic the role of the teacher must change from conveyor of knowledge to a passive learner, to a guide, helping students discover knowledge on there own, being an active learner and helping them stay focused on their learning journey...</li>

<h2 id="toc_57">The Motivation for Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li>Another crucial assumption regarding the nature of the student concerns the level and source of motivation for learning. According to Von Glasersfeld, sustaining motivation to learn is strongly dependent on the student&#39;s confidence of potential for learning.[16] These feelings of competence and belief in potential to solve new problems, are derived from first-hand experience of mastery of problems in the past and are much more important than any external acknowledgment and motivation.[17] This links up with Vygotsky&#39;s &quot;zone of proximal development&quot; where students are challenged in close proximity to, yet slightly above, their current level of development. By experiencing the successful completion of challenging tasks, students gain confidence and motivation to embark on more complex challenges...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>The level and source of motivation for learning are important factors for students.</li>
<li>According to Von Glasersfeld, motivation to learn is closely tied to a student&#39;s confidence in their potential for learning.</li>
<li>The belief in one&#39;s ability to solve new problems comes from firsthand experiences of mastering previous challenges, which is more important than external recognition or rewards.</li>
<li>This connects to Vygotsky&#39;s &quot;zone of proximal development,&quot; where students are challenged just beyond their current level of ability.</li>
<li><p>When students successfully complete challenging tasks in this zone, they gain confidence and motivation to take on even more complex challenges.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_58">Role of the Instructor</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A teacher tells, a facilitator asks</p></li>
<li><p>The learning environment should also be designed to support and challenge the student&#39;s thinking.[23] While it is advocated to give the student ownership of the problem and solution process, it is not the case that any activity or any solution is adequate. The critical goal is to support the student in becoming an effective thinker. This can be achieved by assuming multiple roles, such as consultant and coach...DQ</p></li>

<li><p>By sharing their perspectives and working collaboratively, learners can create a deeper understanding that they couldn&#39;t achieve alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivist scholars believe that students should discover principles and concepts for themselves, encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning is not just happening inside our minds or shaped by external forces, but it&#39;s a social process that occurs through engagement with others.</p></li>
<li><p>Vygotsky emphasized the importance of both practical activity and speech in learning. Practical activity helps us create personal meaning, while speech connects our meaning with the shared world of our culture.</p></li>

<li><p>Holt and Willard-Holt (2000) emphasize the concept of dynamic assessment, which is a way of assessing the true potential of learners that differs significantly from conventional tests. Here, the essentially interactive nature of learning is extended to the process of assessment. Rather than viewing assessment as a process carried out by one person, such as an instructor, it is seen as a two-way process involving interaction between both instructor and learner. The role of the assessor becomes one of entering into dialogue with the persons being assessed to find out their current level of performance on any task and sharing with them possible ways in which that performance might be improved on a subsequent occasion. Thus, assessment and learning are seen as inextricably linked and not separate processes...DQ...</p>

<h2 id="toc_63">Adult Learning</h2></li>
<li><p>Current trends in higher education push for more &quot;active learning&quot; teaching approaches which are often based on constructivist views</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_64">Criticisms</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Some cognitive psychologists and educators have criticized constructivist theories, arguing that they are misleading and contradict established findings.</p></li>
<li><p>Neo-Piagetian theories suggest that learning depends on the cognitive resources available at a particular age. If the requirements of a concept exceed a learner&#39;s processing abilities, the concept may not be learnable.</p></li>
<li><p>Critics question the effectiveness of constructivism in instructional design, especially for novice learners. They argue that &quot;learning by doing&quot; lacks empirical evidence and that guided discovery is more effective.</p>

<li>See: <a href="https://research.ou.nl/en/publications/why-minimal-guidance-during-instruction-does-not-work-an-analysis">https://research.ou.nl/en/publications/why-minimal-guidance-during-instruction-does-not-work-an-analysis</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There is a debate about the appropriate use of constructivism in teaching. Some argue for more structured learning activities for learners with little prior knowledge, while others criticize constructivism as problematic and of limited benefit in practical teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Research suggests that scaffolded constructivist methods, such as problem-based and inquiry learning, are more effective when learners receive guidance and support.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_65">A rebuttal to the criticisms of Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Sweller and his colleagues have discussed instructional designs for procedural learning, which focus on changing behavior through teaching methods.</p></li>
<li><p>They have grouped various learning theories together based on their promotion of the constructivist teaching technique &quot;learning by doing.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Worked examples are considered an effective instructional design solution for procedural learning, supported by empirical evidence across different domains.</p>

<ul>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Chess</li>
<li>Athletics</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The grouping of learning theories is based on the argument that &quot;learning by doing&quot; is more suitable for knowledgeable learners and less effective for novices.</p></li>
<li><p>A continuum of guidance, starting with worked examples, gradually fades guidance to promote cognitive activity rather than behavioral activity.</p></li>
<li><p>This continuum of faded guidance has been empirically tested and linked to learning effects such as the worked-example effect, guidance fading effect, and expertise-reversal effect.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_66">Criticism of Discovery Based Learning</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>After a half century of advocacy associated with instruction using minimal guidance, there appears no body of research supporting the technique. In so far as there is any evidence from controlled studies, it almost uniformly supports direct, strong instructional guidance rather constructivist-based minimal guidance during the instruction of novice to intermediate learners. Even for students with considerable prior knowledge, strong guidance while learning is most often found to be equally effective as unguided approaches. Not only is unguided instruction normally less effective; there is also evidence that it may have negative results when students acquire misconceptions or incomplete or disorganized knowledge</p>

<h2 id="toc_67">ChatGPT4 Summary Using the Link Reader Plugin</h2>

<p>Here is a simplified summary of the Wikipedia article on Constructivism (philosophy of education):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Constructivism is a theory in education that suggests individuals construct new knowledge and understanding through experience and social interaction, rather than passively receiving it. This process involves integrating new information with what they already know.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory has roots in epistemology, a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge. It recognizes that learners have prior knowledge and experiences, often shaped by their social and cultural environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory is linked to the work of Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget&#39;s theory of cognitive development. Piaget focused on how humans make meaning through the interaction between their experiences and their ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Other influential figures in constructivism include Lev Vygotsky, who emphasized the importance of sociocultural learning, and Jerome Bruner, who developed the concept of instructional scaffolding.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivism has influenced various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, education, and the history of science. It examined the interaction between human experiences and their reflexes or behavior-patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivism does not refer to a specific teaching method. However, it often gets confused with constructionism, an educational theory developed by Seymour Papert, inspired by constructivist and experiential learning ideas of Piaget.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory suggests that learning is an active process where learners should discover principles, concepts, and facts for themselves. This emphasizes the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in students.</p></li>
<li><p>Instructors in a constructivist learning environment are seen as facilitators rather than teachers. They help students get to their own understanding of the content.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory also emphasizes the importance of the context in which learning occurs. It views the learning environment as central to the learning itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivism encourages collaboration among learners. Learners with different skills and backgrounds should work together in tasks and discussions to arrive at a shared understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory also stresses the importance of engaging and challenging the student. Learners should constantly be challenged with tasks that refer to skills and knowledge just beyond their current level of mastery.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivism views knowledge as an integrated whole and should not be divided into different subjects or compartments. It also believes that the foundations of any subject can be taught to anybody at any stage in some form.</p></li>
