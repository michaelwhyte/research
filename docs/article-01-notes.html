<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>This study analyzed 28 dissertations from an EdD program to understand how doctoral students identify and study &quot;problems of practice&quot; in education. The findings showed that these problems are typically derived from students&#39; own challenges and real-world dilemmas, focusing on areas such as supporting marginalized students, improving educator professional development, and assisting novice teachers. The study also identified five themes that describe the impact of these dissertation studies on students&#39; local contexts, and provided four guidelines to help future EdD students in identifying their own problems of practice.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">AI Summary of this Section</h3>

<p>The introduction highlights the increased attention on the education doctorate (EdD) and the distinction between EdD and PhD programs, emphasizing the focus of EdD programs on cultivating leadership abilities of professionals to address problems of practice in local settings. It mentions the challenges faced by faculty in designing dissertation experiences for EdD students, and the exploration of alternative formats such as team-produced reports, thematic dissertations, portfolios, projects, and action research/practitioner inquiry dissertations. The defining feature of EdD dissertations is their focus on a problem of practice (PoP), which is described as a persistent, contextualized issue with the potential to improve understanding and outcomes. However, there is a lack of documentation on what constitutes a PoP, its nature, and the impact of studying it on doctoral students&#39; local contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Defintion</strong></p>

<p><strong>EdD:</strong> EdD stands for Doctor of Education. It is a doctoral degree that is focused on professional practice and leadership in the field of education. The EdD program is designed for individuals who are interested in pursuing advanced studies and research in education, with an emphasis on practical application and addressing real-world problems in educational settings. The EdD degree is often pursued by educators, administrators, and other professionals working in educational institutions who seek to enhance their knowledge, skills, and leadership abilities in order to make meaningful contributions to the field of education. (ChatGPT 3.5)</p>

<p><strong>PoP:</strong> In the context of education, a Problem of Practice (PoP) refers to a persistent, specific issue or challenge that is embedded in the work of a professional practitioner within an educational setting. It is a problem that practitioners encounter in their day-to-day work, which has the potential to be addressed and solved through research, analysis, and practical application. </p>

<p>A PoP is typically a complex and contextualized problem that requires deep understanding of the educational system, its stakeholders, and the broader social and cultural factors influencing it. It goes beyond theoretical or abstract concerns and focuses on real-world issues that practitioners face in their professional roles.</p>

<p>Identifying and studying a PoP is a key component of EdD programs, as it allows doctoral students to delve into practical, field-based research and develop solutions that can positively impact educational practice. By investigating PoPs, EdD students aim to gain insights, propose innovative strategies, and contribute to improving educational outcomes, experiences, and understanding within their specific contexts.

<h2 id="toc_5">Literature Review</h2>

<h3 id="toc_6">AI Summary</h3>

<p>The text highlights the historical background of doctoral dissertations, tracing their origins back to the 19th century and their evolution into a common requirement for PhD degrees. It mentions specific studies conducted on EdD dissertations, including one analyzing the dissertations from an online educational technology program and another reviewing dissertations submitted for a Dissertation in Practice (DiP) award. These studies raised questions about the distinctiveness of EdD dissertations and the creation of generative knowledge. The text also mentions a study that focused on the concept of a Problem of Practice (PoP) within EdD dissertations, categorizing different types of research questions related to PoPs. The study described in the text aims to contribute to the literature by examining the entire text of 28 dissertations, exploring the derivation of PoPs and the impact of studying them on EdD students, building upon the previous work on PoPs by Belzer and Ryan.</p>

<p><strong>The above converted into bullet points...</strong></p>

<p>Certainly! Here are the key points summarized as bullet points:</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Findings</h2>

<h3 id="toc_8">Research Question #1: How Do EdD Students Derive their Problems of Practice (PoPs)?</h3>

<p>Here are the key points summarized as bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li><mark>The 28 analyzed dissertations revealed that all the problems of practice (PoPs) were derived from either a &quot;felt difficulty&quot; or a &quot;real-world dilemma&quot; experienced by the doctoral students in their local contexts.</mark></li>
<li><mark>&quot;Felt difficulties&quot; referred to deep concerns or dissatisfactions that practitioners felt a strong urge to address through direct action in their dissertation research.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Examples of <strong>&quot;felt difficulties&quot;</strong> included addressing the needs of English Language Learners in writing instruction, reevaluating Tier Three instructional support in special education, and addressing the academic performance gap between music and other subjects for female students.</mark></li>
<li><mark>On the other hand, <strong>&quot;real-world dilemmas&quot;</strong> represented situations where practitioners had to navigate existing tensions or challenges within larger educational policies and procedures.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Examples of &quot;real-world dilemmas&quot; included dealing with frustrations of teachers implementing new state standards and balancing support for struggling and advanced learners in a detracked honors geometry classroom.</mark></li>
<li>The distinction between &quot;felt difficulties&quot; and &quot;real-world dilemmas&quot; was valuable in helping EdD students identify and frame their PoPs, and both types were found across various professional roles and contexts.</li>
<li>A table provided an overview of the dissertations, their titles, the authors&#39; professional roles, and how the PoPs were categorized.</li>
<li>Among the analyzed dissertations, 8 fell into the category of &quot;felt difficulties&quot; while 20 fell into the category of &quot;real-world dilemmas,&quot; suggesting the prevalence and complexity of dilemmas faced by EdD students.</li>
<li>Regardless of the specific categorization, the significance lies in recognizing the value of both &quot;felt difficulties&quot; and &quot;real-world dilemmas&quot; in helping EdD students identify and frame their PoPs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_9">Research Question #2: What Is the Nature of These Problems of Practice (PoPs) that Our Students Have Studied?</h3>

<p>Here are the key points summarized as bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 28 analyzed dissertations fell into three main categories of Problems of Practice (PoPs): supporting marginalized students or groups (14 dissertations), increasing the quality of educator professional development (9 dissertations), and supporting novices&#39; entry into the profession (3 dissertations).</li>
<li>Within the category of supporting marginalized students or groups, examples included African-American male and female students, English Language Learners, disengaged Haitian American students, struggling and advanced learners, students in early childhood education, visually impaired students, gifted students, LGBTQ students, and students at hard-to-staff schools.</li>
<li>Nine dissertations focused on improving the quality of educator professional development, addressing the need for effective professional learning opportunities, introducing frameworks and reflective tools, and challenging deficit views about specific groups of learners.</li>
<li>Three dissertations focused on supporting novices&#39; entry into the profession, including supporting new teachers and new principals, aiming to enhance their effectiveness and address challenges they face.</li>
<li>The dissertations reflected a passion for making a difference in marginalized students&#39; lives, aligned with the principle of addressing equity, ethics, and social justice in EdD programs.</li>
<li><mark>The findings highlighted the significance of supporting marginalized students, enhancing professional development, and assisting novices in the education profession as areas of focus in EdD dissertations.</mark></li>

<h3 id="toc_10">Research Question #3: What Are the Reported Impacts the Study of Problems of Practice (PoPs) Have on Doctoral Students’ Local Contexts?</h3>

<p>Here are the key points summarized as bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Five generic themes of impact emerged from the analyzed dissertations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Advancing/changing researchers&#39; practice and beliefs</li>
<li>Promoting communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Strengthening/informing policy</li>
<li>Supporting student learning</li>
<li>Fostering colleagues&#39; learning </li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Coding and discussing findings related to the impact of the study of Problems of Practice (PoPs) was challenging due to dissertations having multiple impacts simultaneously and the specific and contextual nature of the impact described by each student.</p></li>
<li><p>Decontextualizing impact from the specific dissertation and local context would diminish its meaning and significance.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a wide variety in the ways students discussed and reported impact, leading to different interpretations by the researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>To gain a more accurate understanding of the impact of dissertation studies, the researchers are embarking on a new study using survey and interview data collection strategies to assess practitioner scholarship after students graduate from the EdD program.</p></li>
<li><p>The additional data sources are expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact, and further details about the derived impact categories will be described in the future study. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_11">Conclusion</h2>

<p>...four principles for deriving PoPs to assist doctoral students across the nation in framing EdD dissertation studies. These principles include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>PoPs are deeply embedded in the students’ professional practice or context.</p></li>
<li><p>PoPs emanate from felt difficulties and real-world dilemmas students face as they work as educational practitioners.</p></li>
<li><p>PoPs align with contemporary, critical issues in education explicated in the literature, such as creating more equitable schooling experiences for all children.</p></li>
<li><p>PoPs hold personal significance for the student’s developing professional identity as a practitioner scholar.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>ChatGPT Summary of Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The analysis resulted in four principles for deriving Problems of Practice (PoPs) in EdD dissertation studies.</p>

<ol>
<li>PoPs are deeply rooted in students&#39; professional practice or context.</li>
<li>PoPs stem from felt difficulties and real-world dilemmas faced by educational practitioners.</li>
<li>PoPs align with contemporary critical issues in education discussed in the literature, such as promoting equity in schooling.</li>
<li>PoPs have personal significance for the student&#39;s professional identity as a practitioner scholar.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The research findings demonstrate that EdD students in the program focused on highly contextualized PoPs, addressing them through direct action or exploring tensions surrounding persistent dilemmas.</p></li>
<li><p>The four principles are being further developed to support EdD students in the program, guiding the naming, framing, and study of PoPs in their dissertations.</p></li>
<li><p>These principles aim to free EdD programs from the constraints of the traditional PhD approach and provide a more tailored and relevant framework for EdD students&#39; research.</p></li>
