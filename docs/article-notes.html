<h2 id="toc_1">From the Abstract</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Information about the literature review that the authors conducted...</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on an extensive review of the literature, this study developed a coding scheme of humanization practices and conducted <mark>content analysis of 244 excerpts of teaching practices from 17 online courses that demonstrated high levels of humanized instruction out of 100 randomly selected online courses at a large community college</mark></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>to offer students a humanized learning experience, it is critical for in- structors to make consistent and regular efforts throughout the course, promote social and aca- demic presence in an integrated way, and proactively guide student social-emotional communication</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In virtual environments, interpersonal interactions rely on computer-mediated communication, which is often text or graphic based and lacks auditory inflections and visual cues that are critical components of in-person communication. This not only imposes barriers to effective communication, but may also lead to feelings of isolation and low levels of engagement in online courses</p></li>
<li><p>researchers and practitioners have consistently emphasized the need to ‚Äúhu- manize‚Äù online learning, where instructors make intentional efforts to enhance the extent to which students feel they are understood and perceived as a real person and are connected to the learning community</p></li>
<li><p>Three key elements of a humanized course</p>

<ol>
<li>student agency</li>
<li>instructor presence</li>
<li>peer presence </li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Very little specific guidance to instructors on how to implement these key elements...</p>

<ul>
<li>The lack of implementation guidance and details adds difficulty for new instructors to incorporate recommended practices in their online courses efficiently and effectively</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="toc_3">Literature Review</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>motivation is fostered when individuals‚Äô voices are heard and choices are respected</p></li>
<li><p>humanized environment should be one that provides choices to students as well as opportunities to reflect on their own learning</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Humanizing online learning involves strategies and practices that incorporate students and instructors as social agents and foster a sense of connection.</li>
<li>The literature on humanization of online learning is derived from three lines of research: academic motivation, Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, and addressing the needs of traditionally disadvantaged students.</li>
<li>Academic motivation research emphasizes the importance of hearing individuals&#39; voices, respecting choices, and providing opportunities for self-reflection.</li>
<li>The CoI framework defines humanization as incorporating cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence to facilitate meaning construction, social connection, and active educational experiences.</li>
<li>Research focusing on traditionally disadvantaged students aims to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion in instructional practices.</li>
<li>The three lines of literature differ in their conceptualizations of humanization, but three consistent elements emerge: student agency, instructor presence, and peer presence.</li>
<li>Student agency involves providing choices and opportunities for reflection.</li>
<li>Instructor presence refers to actively designing and facilitating educational experiences.</li>
<li>Peer presence entails creating a sense of social connection within the learning community.</li>
<li>These elements are essential for humanizing online learning experiences and have implications for student academic outcomes.</li>
<li>Promising instructional practices are discussed for promoting each element.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_4">Student Agency</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Definition of agency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Agency (i.e., autonomy) is considered an innate psychological need of human beings to act freely on one‚Äôs own will</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Definition of student agency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Student agency is commonly defined as students engaging in intentional and self-determined learning activities (Lindgren &amp; McDaniel, 2012; Luo et al., 2019; Martin, 2004) and has been suggested as a critical element of a humanized educational experience</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><mark>students feel a sense of purpose and responsibility and thus will work hard when engaging in activities that are relevant to and/or determined by themselves</mark></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Student agency refers to students engaging in intentional and self-determined learning activities.</li>
<li>It is considered a critical element of a humanized educational experience.</li>
<li>Prior research has shown positive associations between student agency and motivation, engagement, and performance.</li>
<li>Guidelines for supporting student agency in online courses include providing choices of course content and activities, articulating the rationales behind course design, valuing and incorporating student voice, and supporting students in regulating their own learning processes.</li>
<li>Limited choices can undermine students&#39; sense of autonomy, while multiple choices are perceived positively.</li>
<li>Clearly communicating the relevance of assigned activities to learning goals enhances student agency.</li>
<li>Obtaining feedback from students helps address their needs and increases satisfaction.</li>
<li>Supporting students in specifying learning goals, making learning plans, and reflecting on and adjusting their learning processes strengthens student agency in online courses.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_5">Instructor Presence</h3>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...I really need the two instructor presence categories that enhance learning...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Instructors have a crucial role in humanizing online learning by creating the learning environment and facilitating engagement.</li>
<li>Student perceptions of instructor presence significantly correlate with motivation, perceived learning performance, and overall learning satisfaction.</li>
<li><mark>Two major categories of instructor presence are identified: instructor social presence and instructor academic presence.</mark></li>
<li><mark><strong>Instructor social presence</strong> involves developing social and emotional connections with students through self-disclosure and creating a warm, caring, and cohesive atmosphere.</mark></li>
<li><mark><strong>Instructor academic presence</strong> entails actively involving themselves in student learning processes and providing academic support, corresponding to the concept of &quot;teaching presence.&quot;</mark></li>
<li>Practices that enhance instructor academic presence include using visual and media-rich teaching modes, such as audio and video, to deliver content and actively facilitating learning activities.</li>
<li>Approachability and responsiveness are important aspects of instructor academic presence, achieved through inviting student questions, responding quickly to queries and emerging needs, providing timely and constructive feedback, and expressing encouragement and support regularly.</li>
<li>Prior research shows positive relationships between instructor academic presence and students&#39; sense of learning community, satisfaction with online courses, and course performance.</li>
<li>These practices contribute to fostering instructor-student connections and creating an engaging online learning environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_6">Peer Presense</h3>

<ul>
<li>Peer social presence describes the extent to which students feel connected with their peers and see each other as real people

<ul>
<li>For example:

<ul>
<li>one instructional practice that has demonstrated potential to improve peer social presence is icebreaker activities, such as self-introduction assignments (Martin &amp; Bolliger, 2018)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><mark>critical for instructors to facilitate such social interaction</mark></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Peer presence is an essential element of a humanized online learning experience, promoting a sense of belonging and facilitating group interactions centered on academic content.</li>
<li>Challenges in achieving meaningful peer interactions in online courses include reduced social cues and difficulties in coordinating group activities.</li>
<li>Strategies for enhancing peer presence can be categorized into social presence and academic presence.</li>
<li>Peer social presence involves creating opportunities for students to feel connected with their peers, such as through icebreaker activities, while instructors play a role in facilitating respectful and inclusive peer exchanges.</li>
<li>Peer academic presence focuses on providing opportunities for learning through communication and collaboration with peers, such as group assignments, peer discussion boards, and peer feedback.</li>
<li>Instructors need to facilitate and support academic interactions among students, including clarifying shared goals, providing clear instructions, monitoring progress, giving feedback, and guiding students in forming effective study groups.</li>
<li>These practices promote critical thinking, reflection, co-creation of knowledge, and a sense of community among students.</li>
<li>Theoretical and empirical research has established the importance of student agency, instructor presence, and peer presence for a humanized online learning experience.</li>
<li>This study aims to identify and examine specific instructional practices that humanize online courses by developing a coding scheme and analyzing concrete examples of instructors implementing these practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_7">Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The research design utilized qualitative content analysis to examine online instructors&#39; humanization practices.</li>
<li>A coding scheme was developed based on a theory-driven approach and the existing literature, focusing on student agency, instructor presence, and peer presence.</li>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> From the response above you mentioned &quot;Intercoder reliability&quot; what does that mean?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Intercoder reliability refers to the degree of agreement or consistency between multiple coders who independently code the same data. In qualitative research, it is important to establish intercoder reliability to ensure that different coders are interpreting and applying the coding scheme consistently. By calculating measures such as Cohen&#39;s kappa, intercoder reliability assesses the level of agreement between coders and helps identify areas where coding criteria may need clarification or refinement. High intercoder reliability indicates that coders are coding the data in a consistent and reliable manner, increasing the overall validity of the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you clarify what a &quot;coder&quot; is in this context?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Certainly! In the context of qualitative research and content analysis, a &quot;coder&quot; refers to an individual or researcher who systematically examines and categorizes data based on a predefined coding scheme. The coding scheme consists of a set of codes and guidelines that coders use to identify and assign meaningful categories or labels to specific portions of the data. Coders carefully review the data and apply the appropriate codes to capture relevant information or patterns. Each coder independently evaluates the data, and intercoder reliability is assessed by comparing their coding decisions to ensure consistency and agreement. The process of coding helps researchers organize and analyze qualitative data, enabling them to identify themes, patterns, or insights within the data set.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Thank for all this...Can you re-explain &quot;interceder reliability&quot; but do it in the context of if your audience was a student in grade 10 trying to understand this concept...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Of course! Imagine you and a classmate are working together on a research project. Your task is to analyze some information and categorize it based on specific guidelines. Inter-coder reliability is like checking how well you and your classmate agree on the categories and labels you assign to the information. It&#39;s important to have high intercoder reliability because it shows that both of you are consistently understanding and applying the guidelines in the same way. When you have good intercoder reliability, it means that your results are more reliable and trustworthy. It&#39;s like having a strong agreement between you and your classmate, making your research findings more credible.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Results</h2>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Please summarize this section into a few key bullet points...The full article is about humanizing the learning environment for online learners...Here is the text to summarize:...</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subsequent responses will use the same prompt, unless otherwise noted...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The coding process identified eight techniques used by instructors to humanize online courses.</li>
<li>Techniques to enhance student agency include creating and maintaining a sense of purpose for the course and facilitating ongoing feedback from students.</li>
<li>Techniques to enhance instructor presence involve consolidating social and academic presence, establishing and maintaining instructor-student relationships, and providing multi-staged support throughout each learning unit.</li>
<li>Techniques to enhance peer presence include creating an inclusive and collegial class culture through online social etiquette and scaffolding multi-step collaborative assignments.</li>
<li>Peer socio-emotional communication is promoted by having students share their feelings on course content and providing guidance on expressing emotions in an online class setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_9">Discussion and Implications</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Our results indicate that the instructors in our sample typically incorporated consistent efforts through multiple ways to bring a humanized experience to students throughout the course. For instance, to enhance students‚Äô sense of purpose in a course, instructors helped students to identify a connection between the course and their career and life at the beginning of the course, and continued to solidify the connection through tasks tailored to student needs as the course progressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the prior studies have examined instructional practices that target social presence or academic presence separately (e.g., Russo &amp; Benson, 2005; Shea et al., 2006). Yet, our results suggest that instructors integrated the two together to optimize student learning experiences. </p>

<ul>
<li>For example:

<ul>
<li>when instructors provided feedback and academic suggestions on the coursework of struggling students, they also indicated strong confidence in student ability and care for student success to relieve students‚Äô anxiety and create a supportive environment</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_10">Summary of Key Findings</h3>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent efforts throughout the course: Instructors in the study incorporated consistent efforts to humanize the online learning experience, such as helping students identify the relevance of the course to their lives and careers, providing ongoing support in group projects, offering guidance on etiquette, and using clear grading rubrics.</li>
<li>Promoting social and academic presence in an integrated way: Instead of focusing solely on social or academic presence, instructors integrated both aspects to optimize student learning experiences. For example, when providing feedback, instructors also expressed confidence in students&#39; abilities and showed care for their success.</li>
<li>Developing a sense of community through social-emotional communication:   - Instructors can strengthen students&#39; sense of community by promoting and guiding peer-to-peer social-emotional communication. 

<ul>
<li>This is important because positive peer communication and relationships contribute to student engagement and persistence in online courses. </li>
<li>The study provides examples of how instructors can facilitate appropriate peer socio-emotional communication and address challenges associated with virtual learning environments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_11">Research and practical implications</h3>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Coding scheme for research: The study developed a comprehensive coding scheme that synthesizes prior literature on instructional practices that humanize online learning. This coding scheme can be used in future research to examine the relationships between these practices and students&#39; academic and socio-emotional outcomes.</li>
<li>Implementation techniques: The qualitative approach allowed the study to capture specific implementation techniques used by instructors to humanize their online courses, providing concrete examples for each technique. Future research can explore the impact of these techniques on students&#39; sense of agency, instructor presence, peer presence, and performance outcomes.</li>
<li>Practical implications for professional development: 

<ul>
<li>The findings can be valuable for professional development programs for online instructors. </li>
<li>The coding framework and detailed explanation of implementation techniques can serve as resources to help instructors revamp their online courses and provide a systematic professional development experience.</li>
</ul></li>
