<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26, 2023</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of the PDF article &quot;How to use (five) curriculum design principles to align authentic learning environments, assessment, students’ approaches to thinking and learning outcomes&quot; by Noel M. Meyers &amp; Duncan D. Nulty:</p>

<ul>
<li>The article discusses five principles of curriculum design and their application in a third-year undergraduate course for environmental and ecological scientists.</li>
<li>The five principles are: 

<ol>
<li>Develop materials, tasks, and experiences that are authentic, real-world, and relevant.</li>
<li>Develop materials, tasks, and experiences which are constructive, sequential, and interlinked.</li>
<li>Require students to use and engage with progressively higher-order cognitive processes.</li>
<li>Ensure all components are aligned with each other and the desired learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Provide challenge, interest, and motivation to learn.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The authors argue that by applying these principles, educators can guide students towards progressively more complex thinking and practice.</li>
<li>The curriculum design was implemented in a course that required students to learn about science through practicing the scientific method.</li>
<li>The course materials, tasks, and experiences were constructed around material derived from scientific study of the tropical island of Lys, providing an authentic and relevant learning environment.</li>
<li>The assessment strategy was integrated and required students to integrate, synthesize, and construct their understandings in ways to allow them to think like professionals.</li>
<li>The authors argue that by manipulating the learning system in ways that require students to adopt a deep learning approach, it is possible to meet the course’s assessment requirements and desired learning outcomes.</li>
<li>The article provides a detailed description of the students&#39; learning journey, including the sequence of the course teaching, learning materials, and tasks.</li>
<li>The authors conclude that the five principles of curriculum design can provide a practical framework for others wishing to enhance their students’ learning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PDF Summarized into a paragraph by ChatGPT 4 with the Link Reader plugin</strong></p>

<p>The article &quot;How to use (five) curriculum design principles to align authentic learning environments, assessment, students’ approaches to thinking and learning outcomes&quot; by Noel M. Meyers &amp; Duncan D. Nulty presents a curriculum design approach for a third-year undergraduate course for environmental and ecological scientists. <strong><em>The authors propose five principles: authenticity and relevance, constructiveness and sequence, engagement with higher cognitive processes, alignment with learning outcomes, and provision of challenge and motivation</em></strong>. By applying these principles, they argue that educators can guide students towards complex thinking and practice. The curriculum was implemented in a course that used the scientific method and was based on a case study of the tropical island of Lys, providing an authentic learning environment. The assessment strategy was integrated, requiring students to think like professionals. The authors conclude that these principles can enhance student learning.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>CHATGPT 3.5 - May 29, 2023 Summary of introduction paragraphs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Authentic assessment requires students to apply the same competencies needed in real-life professional situations.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments foster disciplinary behaviors and problem-solving skills used by professionals in the field.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments go beyond traditional assessments by deeply engaging students, developing valuable skills, and measuring meaningful learning.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments promote academic integrity by requiring students to demonstrate their capacity and competencies.</li>
<li>Complex, unique, and creative activities in authentic assessments increase student engagement and encourage academic integrity.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments often have multiple solutions, requiring students to use theoretical knowledge to respond to complex and ambiguous problems.</li>
<li>Authentic assessment aligns with universal design principles, allowing students multiple means of expression.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">Examples</h2>

<h2 id="toc_5">Designing Authentic Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To help get started with designing authentic assessments, Anderson and Little of Elon University (Anderson &amp; Little, 2001) [1] have created a tool which consists of the following 7 questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the learning outcome for this assessment?</li>
<li>What is the student’s role (a specialist, a friend, a professional)?</li>
<li>Who is the audience for this task?</li>
<li>What is the problem or question?</li>
<li>Why does the audience need this information?</li>
<li>How can the student and the audience use this information?</li>
<li>How will the student communicate this information to the audience?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="toc_6">Examples of Authentic Assessment</h2>

<p>Certainly! Here&#39;s the modified markdown text:</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Business</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Develop a marketing plan for a local small business (adapted from UBC COMM 296):</strong>

<ul>
<li>Part 1: Effective marketing strategies can only be created after a thorough situation analysis of the current and future internal and external conditions under which a company will compete.</li>
<li>Part 2: Segmentation, targeting, and positioning (STP) form the foundation for a company’s entire marketing plan – all strategies must align with these components – so clearly defining them is critical to the company’s success.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_8">Psychology</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plan a Behavioural Modification Project (adapted from J.Mueller):</strong>

<ul>
<li>Choose a specific subject/behaviour to modify and complete a literature search.</li>
<li>Design a plan to complete the eight steps of behaviour modification.</li>
<li>Collect baseline data for approximately one week. Complete the eight steps of your plan, be sure to administer the schedule(s) for at least two weeks.</li>
<li>Write up your program.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_9">Math</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Examples of authentic numeracy assessment questions (Taken from Ward et al., 2011):</strong>

<ul>
<li>If 1 gallon of paint covers 250−400 square feet, how much paint do you need for a room that is 20×15 feet? There are 3 windows which are 30×60 inches. The room has a door which is 38×82.75 inches and has 8-foot ceilings.</li>
<li>Most automobiles get about 28% more miles per gallon of fuel at 50 miles per hour than at 70 miles per hour. How much more gas will you use in a trip of 350 miles going 70 miles per hour than 50 miles per hour? How much more time will it take you to complete the trip mentioned in the previous question if you are traveling 50 miles per hour (versus 70 miles per hour)?</li>
<li>You want to make a small cake. You plan on using ½ of a cake mix. If the box tells you to use 1/3 cup of oil, how much do you need to make your small cake?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_10">Journalism</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create a News Brief (adapted from J.Mueller):</strong>

<ul>
<li>You are a producer for an evening television news program. Your task is to create a 5 minute news brief of the major headlines for a single day. Focusing on national news, compile and annotate the daily news from online and broadcast feeds as well as newspapers. Select 8 stories you believe should be included in an evening newscast. Develop news blocks and build a mini-rundown beginning with the lead story. Include the types of elements you could include in each of the news blocks (i.e. video, sound bites, text, images, interviews)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_11">Language Class</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create a travel Brochure (Adapted from Reach Everyone, Teach Everyone, Behling and Tobin, 2018 p. 192):</strong>

<ul>
<li>Pick a place a Spanish speaking place and create a travel brochure. In the brochure, identify the capital, note tourist attractions, find aspects of the country, community, and culture that are not well known.</li>

<h2 id="toc_18">What is Authentic Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>ChatGPT 3.5 Summary - May 28, 2023</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Authentic assessment involves students demonstrating mastery through the development of products or performance of realistic tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Mastery in traditional assessment may not align with real-world capacities or authentic learning situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic assessment does not imply comprehensive coverage of the curriculum or mastery but can enhance both.</p></li>
<li><p>Different opinions exist regarding the definition of authenticity, with some emphasizing the task and context, while others focus on performance assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic assessment requires students to use the same competencies they would apply in professional life situations.</p></li>
<li><p>It aims to make visible and measurable the integrated performance of learned elements relevant to real-world conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic learning tasks elicit and assess integrated performance, reflecting relationships among knowledge, skills, and attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic assessment resembles meaningful performances in real-world contexts and involves real-life tasks with multiple solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires students to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and ability to solve real-life problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic assessment addresses the weak assessment of reflective and social knowing in traditional assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Curriculum in authentic assessment is driven by the tasks students are required to perform, rather than vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Authenticity in assessment exists on a continuum, depending on how closely it reflects specific attributes.</p></li>
</ul>

Here&#39;s the reformatted text with an ordered numbered list:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The task: The assessment task should involve activities that reflect professional practice, allowing students to demonstrate their skills in a real-world context. What do you have to do?</p></li>
<li><p>A physical context: The assessment should mirror the use of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in real places of work, going beyond institutional learning environments. Where do you have to do it?</p></li>
<li><p>A social context: Authentic assessment tasks should involve social processes that resemble real-life situations, which may include teamwork and collaboration based on the demands of the context. With whom do you have to do it?</p></li>
<li><p>The assessment result or form: The assessment should result in a product or performance, demonstrating competencies through a variety of tasks, and may involve oral and/or written presentations. What has to come out of it? What is the result of your efforts?</p></li>

<p><strong>ChatGPT 3.5 summary</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of the practical tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authentic assessment definitions can be pedantic, so a combination of traditional and authentic assessment tasks can be appropriate.</li>
<li>Move incrementally towards more authentic assessment by changing one task or context at a time.</li>
<li>Collaborate with colleagues, including those from other disciplines, when designing authentic assessment tasks.</li>
<li>Adapt or modify existing approaches instead of reinventing the wheel.</li>
<li>Devise tasks that immerse students in realistic projects with time for planning, information gathering, consultation, revision, and self-assessment.</li>
<li>Clearly communicate the processes and outcomes expected in authentic assessment to students, involving them in the development of criteria.</li>
<li>Explore simulation technology possibilities for enacting authentic assessment, even through small, incremental developments.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ChatGPT 3.5 summary into a paragraph</strong></p>

<p>In summary, here are practical tips for implementing authentic assessment:</p>

<p>Definitions of authentic assessment can be detailed, but not all assessments need to strictly align with the definition. Combining traditional and authentic assessment tasks can be appropriate in various disciplines. If a complete assessment redesign is not feasible, gradually move towards more authentic assessment by changing one task, context, or aspect at a time. Collaborating with colleagues, including those from different disciplines, increases the likelihood of creating authentic tasks. Instead of starting from scratch, learn from colleagues and adapt or modify existing approaches. Design tasks that immerse students in realistic projects, allowing sufficient time for planning, information gathering, consultations, revisions, and self-assessment. Ensure that students have a clear understanding of the processes and expected outcomes of authentic assessment, and involving them in developing assessment criteria can enhance clarity. Lastly, explore the potential of simulation technology for authentic assessment, as even small, incremental developments can be successful in this area without requiring extensive funding or major practice changes.</p>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> Bing Chat</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> How can constructivism learning theory help educators create assessments in a world full AI LLMs?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Constructivist learning theory can help educators create assessments in a world full of AI LLMs by incorporating the use of artificial intelligence technology to enhance the learning process. The theory of AI-Assisted Constructivism expands on the traditional constructivist theory of learning by recognising that learning is an active process in which individuals construct their own understanding of the world through experiences and interactions with others. Additionally, it recognises the importance of observation, imitation, and modeling in the learning process [1].</p>

<p>Therefore, educators can use AI-Assisted Constructivism to create assessments that focus on developing the learners’ knowledge by constructing the world around them through experience, observation, documentation, analysis and reflection [2].</p>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of the article in bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The article is a study titled &quot;The effect of practical experience on perceptions of assessment authenticity, study approach, and learning outcomes&quot; by Judith T.M. Gulikers, Liesbeth Kester, Paul A. Kirschner, and Theo J. Bastiaens.</p></li>
<li><p>The study investigates whether authentic assessment or the perception of it affects how students study and learn, and whether practical experience influences how an authentic assessment affects student learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The study uses a mixed methods design to gain insights into these questions.</p></li>
<li><p>The researchers found differences in how freshman and senior student groups perceive the same authentic assessment and how this assessment influences their learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The study suggests that practical experience might change a student&#39;s ideas of professional practice, which might in turn change the perception of authenticity of an assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>The study also suggests that the relationship between perception of assessment authenticity and student learning and professional skill development is stable over the years.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The study hypothesizes that an increase in the perception of authenticity of any of the five assessment dimensions and/or of alignment results in increased development of generic skills either directly or indirectly through encouraging a deep study approach.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>This required clarification...MW...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The study used two regular summative assessments that were designed to be authentic assessments by the participating VET College for Social Work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>The study concludes that the same authentic assessment might be effective for students with little experience in professional practice, while being less effective for students who have more professional experience or vice versa</mark></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The study suggests that there is a need for different kinds of authentic assessments for students with different amounts of experience in professional practice.</p></li>
<li><p>The study also suggests that the relationships described in the hypothesised model might be affected by students’ differential practical experience.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I asked for clarification on point 9 above...</strong></p>

<p>The five assessment dimensions mentioned in the study are based on the five-dimensional framework for assessment authenticity developed by Gulikers, Bastiaens, and Kirschner in 2004. These dimensions represent different characteristics of an assessment that can contribute to its perceived authenticity. While the specific details of these dimensions are not explicitly provided in the extracted content from the PDF, based on the authors&#39; previous works, these dimensions typically include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Task:</strong> This refers to the nature of the tasks or problems presented in the assessment. Authentic tasks are usually complex, real-world problems that mirror the kind of work students would do in a professional setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Context:</strong> This refers to the environment in which the assessment takes place. An authentic physical context would closely resemble the actual setting where the knowledge or skills being assessed would be applied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Context:</strong> This refers to the social and collaborative aspects of the assessment. In many professional settings, tasks are not completed in isolation but involve interaction and collaboration with others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Form of Assessment:</strong> This refers to the way the assessment is structured and delivered. Authentic assessments often involve performance-based tasks, projects, or portfolios rather than traditional tests or exams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Criteria:</strong> This refers to the criteria used to evaluate student performance. Authentic assessment criteria are typically performance-based and aligned with real-world expectations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The study hypothesizes that when students perceive these dimensions of an assessment as closely resembling their professional practice, it can lead to deeper learning and the development of generic skills. This can occur either directly, through the nature of the tasks and the context in which they are completed, or indirectly, by encouraging students to adopt a deep approach to studying.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ok...Makes sense...If students see an assessment as similar to their professional lives, they learn more effectively... </li>

<h2 id="toc_30">Definition of Constructivism</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Constructivism is the theory that says learners construct knowledge rather than just passively take in information...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Related to this are the processes of assimilation and accommodation.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Assimilation</strong> refers to the process of taking new information and fitting it into an existing schema.</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation</strong> refers to using newly acquired information to revise and redevelop an existing schema.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The above points are ...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Good analogy</strong></p>

<p>For example, if I believe that friends are always nice, and meet a new person who is always nice to me I may call this person a friend, assimilating them into my schema. Perhaps, however, I meet a different person who sometimes pushes me to try harder and is not always nice. I may decide to change my schema to accommodate this person by deciding a friend doesn’t always need to be nice if they have my best interests in mind. Further, this may make me reconsider whether the first person still fits into my friend schema...DQ...</p>

<h2 id="toc_31">Benefits of Constructivism</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Students learn best when engaged in learning experiences rather passively receiving information</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Learning is inherently a social process</em></strong> because it is embedded within a social context as students and teachers work together to build knowledge.</li>
<li><p>Because knowledge cannot be directly imparted to students, the <strong><em>goal of teaching is to provide experiences that facilitate the construction of knowledge</em></strong>.</p></li>

<li><strong>Elicit prior knowledge:</strong> Begin lessons by activating students&#39; existing knowledge through pre-tests, interviews, or group activities that require recalling prior knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Create cognitive dissonance:</strong> Challenge students with problems and activities that push them to encounter new situations, prompting them to revise their existing understanding and build new knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Apply knowledge with feedback:</strong> Encourage students to evaluate new information and modify their existing knowledge. Provide opportunities for comparing pre-existing schemas to novel situations through presentations, discussions, and quizzes.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect on learning:</strong> Allow students to demonstrate their learning through activities such as presentations, reflexive papers, or creating tutorials for their peers, giving them a chance to showcase their understanding.</li>
</ol>

<p>These components emphasize the importance of activating prior knowledge, promoting active engagement with challenging problems, providing feedback for learning application, and fostering reflection on acquired knowledge.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Constructivism is a learning theory that posits learners construct knowledge rather than just passively absorbing information</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>This construction of knowledge happens as people experience the world and reflect upon those experiences, building their own representations and incorporating new information into their pre-existing knowledge, also known as schemas.</p></li>
<li><p>***Two key processes in this theory are assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation involves fitting new information into an existing schema, while accommodation involves revising and redeveloping an existing schema based on newly acquired information.</p>

<hr></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Constructivism suggests that learning is a social process</em></strong>, embedded within a social context as students and teachers work together to build knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal of teaching, according to constructivism, is not to directly impart information, but to provide experiences that facilitate the construction of knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Constructivist principles can have significant implications for teaching and the classroom. Some key components to include in a constructivist classroom or lesson plan are: eliciting prior knowledge, creating cognitive dissonance, applying knowledge with feedback, and reflecting on learning.</p></li>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 26, 2023</p>

<p>Here are the key points from the article:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The article discusses the concept of &quot;Authentic Learning,&quot; a pedagogical approach that situates learning tasks in real-world situations. This approach is seen as a means to enable students to develop robust knowledge that transfers to real-world practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentic learning has its foundations in the theory of situated cognition, along with other pedagogical approaches such as anchored instruction. It offers an alternative instructional model based on principles for the design and implementation of complex and realistic learning tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>The technologies associated with technology-based learning provide ideal conditions for the implementation of the approach, both in blended and fully online courses. New Web-based technologies and mobile devices provide affordances for dissemination of polished and professional authentic learning experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>The article provides a framework of authentic learning, which includes elements like an authentic context, authentic tasks, access to expert performances, multiple roles and perspectives, collaborative construction of knowledge, reflection, articulation, coaching and scaffolding, and authentic assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors argue that these elements should be considered as design guidelines rather than mandatory characteristics. Any learning environment or task can only be considered more or less authentic, so that elements are best viewed across a continuum.</p></li>
<li><p>The article also discusses the application of authentic learning in practice, noting that well-designed authentic tasks can be used at multiple levels of education. It suggests that authentic tasks are not provided simply to enable students to practice skills that have been taught in more traditional ways, but rather to guide the entire learning process.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I asked ChatGPT to expand on the third point from the list above</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you expand on this point...any additional information from the authors on this point...Here is the point: &quot;The technologies associated with technology-based learning provide ideal conditions for the implementation of the approach, both in blended and fully online courses.

<p><strong>Model:</strong> Bing Chat</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> how does authentic assessment align with Constructivist learning theory?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Constructivist learning theory is a theory about how people learn. It states that people construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world by experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. To do this, we have to ask questions, explore, and assess what we know [1]. Authentic assessment is an assessment that is part of the learning process. Authentic Assessments measure learning which has meaning for the learner beyond a particular class addressing the skills and abilities needed to perform real-world tasks [2]. Authentic Learning is rooted in constructivist theory, which says that actively engaging with problems and materials constitutes the best way to learn [3].</p>

<p>Therefore, authentic assessment aligns with Constructivist learning theory because it measures learning which has meaning for the learner beyond a particular class addressing the skills and abilities needed to perform real-world tasks [2].</p>

<p>Authentic Learning is an approach that involves learning activities closely connected to real-world contexts or with high applicability to the real world. It emphasizes personal and cultural relevance, where learners can connect new information to their own lives and understand how it relates to the practices of the academic discipline. In this student-centered approach, instructors facilitate learning rather than dictate it, allowing students to explore and engage with the learning tasks. Authentic Learning is rooted in constructivist theory, which highlights active problem-solving and sense-making. It can be implemented through various methods such as case-based instruction, inquiry projects, and project-based assessment. Reflection and synthesis play a crucial role in maximizing the effectiveness of authentic learning. Challenges in implementing this approach include instructors&#39; disconnection from the real-world context and the need to recreate authentic scenarios in the classroom. However, authentic learning leads to deeper and more meaningful learning experiences, higher motivation, and better academic outcomes.</p>

<h1 id="toc_46">04-00 ChatGPT 4 - How Does Authentic Assessment Align with Constructivism</h1>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Bing</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> how does authentic assessment align with Constructivist learning theory?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Constructivist learning theory is based on the idea that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. It emphasizes the active role of the learner in building understanding and making sense of information.</p>

<p>Authentic assessment, on the other hand, is a form of assessment in which students are asked to perform real-world tasks that demonstrate meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills. It mirrors the tasks and problem-solving that are encountered in the world outside of school.</p>

<p>These two concepts align in several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Active Learning:</strong> Both authentic assessment and constructivist learning theory emphasize the active role of the learner. In constructivist learning, students are actively constructing their own knowledge. Similarly, in authentic assessment, students are actively involved in the assessment process through real-world tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Learning:</strong> Constructivist theory emphasizes that learning is deeply contextual and is influenced by the environment in which it occurs. Authentic assessment reinforces this by requiring students to apply their knowledge and skills in real-world contexts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complex Problem Solving:</strong> Constructivism posits that meaningful learning occurs when learners grapple with complex, real-world problems. Authentic assessment aligns with this by presenting students with complex tasks that mirror those they will encounter in the world beyond the classroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflection and Metacognition:</strong> Both constructivist learning and authentic assessment value reflection and metacognition. Constructivist learning theory sees reflection as a key part of the learning process, where learners reflect on and interpret their experiences to construct new understanding. Authentic assessment often incorporates reflection as well, asking students to think about their work, their learning processes, and the implications of their findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Both constructivist learning theory and authentic assessment often emphasize the value of collaboration. Constructivism recognizes that our understandings are socially constructed, and authentic assessments often involve collaborative tasks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In essence, authentic assessment can be seen as an extension of constructivist learning theory into the realm of assessment. It carries forward the principles of active, contextual, problem-based, reflective, and collaborative learning into the way students&#39; understanding and skills are evaluated.  </p>

<p><strong>Asking for clarification on reflection and metacognition</strong></p>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 3.5</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What does reflection and metacognition in the context of learning theories mean?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>In the context of learning theories, reflection and metacognition are two concepts that focus on higher-order thinking processes related to learning and cognition.</p>

<p>Reflection refers to the act of thinking about and analyzing one&#39;s own experiences, actions, and knowledge. It involves introspection and thoughtful consideration of what has been learned, how it was learned, and how it can be applied in the future. Reflection encourages individuals to engage in a deeper level of learning by examining their thoughts, feelings, and actions in order to gain insights and improve their understanding. It involves asking questions, making connections, and critically evaluating one&#39;s own learning process and outcomes.</p>

<p>Metacognition, on the other hand, involves the awareness and understanding of one&#39;s own cognitive processes. It refers to the ability to think about and regulate one&#39;s own thinking. Metacognitive skills include planning, monitoring, and evaluating one&#39;s own learning. It involves being aware of what one knows and doesn&#39;t know, setting goals, selecting appropriate strategies for learning, monitoring progress, and making adjustments as needed. Metacognition allows learners to take control of their own learning process, make informed decisions about how to approach a task, and adapt their strategies based on their understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Both reflection and metacognition play important roles in effective learning. They promote deep understanding, self-regulation, and the development of critical thinking skills. By engaging in reflection and metacognition, learners become more active and autonomous in their learning process, leading to enhanced learning outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Back to the original prompt question that asked about authentic assessments and constructivism</strong></p>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Bing</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Are you able to provide sources to your previous response?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Authentic assessment aligns with the Constructivist learning theory in several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Constructivism is a theory about how people learn. It believes that people construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world by experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. To do this, we ask questions, explore, and assess what we know. As such, learning and collaboration should emulate real-world environments and problem-solving, creative thinking, and inquiry should be emphasized. Products and presentations should be used as evidence of learning, not standardized tests. Learning should encourage collaboration both in and out of the classroom. Therefore, assessment should be authentic in nature. Constructivist Learning favors authentic assessment; assessment that is part of the learning process. Authentic Assessments measure learning which has meaning for the learner beyond a particular class, addressing the skills and abilities needed to perform real-world tasks [​1]​.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments involve the application of knowledge and skills in real-world situations, scenarios, or problems. They create a student-centered learning experience by providing students opportunities to problem-solve, inquire, and create new knowledge and meaning​ [2]​.</li>
<li>Authentic assessments have several elements to consider including:

<ul>
<li>Accuracy and validity: The accuracy of the assessment refers to how closely it resembles a real-world situation, problem, disciplinary norm, or field of study. The assessment validity refers to the alignment of grading criteria to the learning objectives, transferable skills (e.g., communication, critical thinking, etc.), workforce readiness skills, and disciplinary norms and practices.</li>
<li>Demonstration of learning: The outcomes of an assessment should allow students to demonstrate learning in ways that reflect their field of study. The assessment should allow for student choice based on interests and skills.</li>
<li>Transfer of knowledge: The assessment should provide the transfer of knowledge from theory to practice and from one task or experience to another.</li>
<li>Metacognition: The process of reflecting on learning should be purposefully planned for students to make connections to prior knowledge, experiences, and different subject areas.</li>
<li>Collaboration: The assessments should provide opportunities for interaction that are aligned to the real-world situation​ [2]​.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, the assessment should provide flexibility in the timeline and due dates for meeting project benchmarks and deliverables to align with real-world tasks. The environment and tools used to provide the assessment should be like the environments and tools in the students’ field of study or aligned with a real-world situation [​2]​.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Authentic assessments can also be referred to as alternative assessments or performance-based assessments. All of these assessments are considered “alternatives” to traditional high-stakes tests or research papers, and are based on the constructivist theory where students actively construct new meaning and knowledge [​2]​.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also important to understand that authentic assessments can be used to assess students both formatively (during instruction) and summatively (when the instruction is over) [2]​.</p></li>

<p>Here is a summary of the PDF document titled &quot;A five-dimensional framework for authentic assessment&quot; by Judith T. M. Gulikers, Theo J. Bastiaens, and Paul A. Kirschner:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The paper discusses the concept of authentic assessment, which is an important element of new modes of assessment. However, the authors argue that the definition of what constitutes authentic assessment is often unspecified.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors propose a five-dimensional framework for designing authentic assessments, with professional practice as the starting point. The five dimensions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>The assessment task</li>
<li>The physical context</li>
<li>The social context</li>
<li>The assessment result or form</li>
<li>The assessment criteria</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The authors argue that authentic assessment should be aligned with authentic instruction in order to positively influence student learning. They also stress that students should see a link between the assessment task and their personal interests or real-world situations for the task to be perceived as relevant and meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>The paper also highlights the importance of the physical and social context in authentic assessment. The physical context should reflect the way knowledge, skills, and attitudes will be used in professional practice, while the social context should consider social processes that are present in real-life contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>The paper emphasizes that the assessment result or form should resemble the output in a real-life situation. The assessment criteria should reflect the criteria used in professional practice.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors conducted a qualitative study to determine if the framework is complete and to understand the relative importance of the five dimensions in the perceptions of students and teachers at a nursing college. The results of this study are discussed in the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the framework and important issues that need to be considered when designing authentic assessments. </p></li>

<li><p>Sorry, VP-Finances reading this (lol, imagine a VP-Finance reading this), but it’s just not possible to scale up good writing instruction. Writing is hard work and it’s heart work — it involves revision and effort. It needs attention and care. It requires investment: small classes, time, professional development, and integration across the curriculum...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>This is true, writing well is a full time pursuit...A profession...Most people do not have time to dedicate to perfecting their writing...especially in a world that just needs the infortmation quickly. As long as the writing is clear, it is often good enough for the everyday world...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If ChatGPT didn’t work for the kinds of writing we assign and assess at the undergraduate level, we would have nothing to worry about. And for that reason, <mark>I don’t think this is an academic integrity issue — I think it’s an assessment integrity issue</mark>. We treat those like they are the same thing, but they’re not...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology is not the issue (ChatGPT) it is how we are assessing that is more of the issue...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This quote is not really related...then again, maybe it is...I got a kick out of this line...
-<mark>Turnitin, a company with the ethical core of a rotting banana...</mark></p></li>
<li><p>...we cannot simply issue blanket bans. This will be as embedded in the process of writing as grammar and spell checkers are now — which, too, was once considered an unthinkable crutch for bad writers to lean on...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology and norms evolve...I agree...In the future, AI assisted writing will just be the way it is done...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But much like most of us used to tell our students to stay away from Wikipedia (which is a bad comparison on many levels, not least because it was always misguided advice), we have a losing battle on our hands. It was always better to talk about how to use Wikipedia responsibly than to imagine we could keep students away from it...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>If a tool is used in the real world, it is better not to keep students from it...Instead we should show students how to use it...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_50">Solutions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Talk to students about ChatGPT. What are its problems and shortcomings? How do you see the work it produces as falling short of your standards? What do you see as the AI implications in your discipline?</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate for process, not just product. When we only collect the finished product, there&#39;s little incentive for students to learn the process — and the kind of thinking essay writing requires means a lot of process work. Help students to understand <em>how</em> to write well in your discipline and how to establish good habits around writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Include reflection in your assessments, both in terms of how the content is relevant to students and in terms of the process they undertook. Thinking though how an assignment went (especially before the instructor marks it) can really help students to develop skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Think critically about your assessments. If you assign essays, do you have a reason for that? And do you provide essay writing instruction? The essay is often the default mode of assessment, but that puts a lot of pressure on the final product, and often students have little support in developing it. Are there other ways to assess learning that might be more effective?</p></li>

<ol>
<li>Be open with your students about ChatGPT</li>
<li>It is often more the journey than the destination

<ul>
<li>Evaluate the process that led to the product</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reflect on the process of developing the product</li>
<li>Are your assessments relevant</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_51">What Not To Do</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t ramp up surveillance or look for a technological solution to what is ultimately a pedagogical problem. That&#39;s an arms race and I can tell you right now, education does not have the means to win it.</p></li>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t try banning ChatGPT. First of all, once it&#39;s packaged with Microsoft it&#39;s all game over anyway. It won&#39;t go away because we stick our heads in the sand.</p></li>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t give up on the essay. I would probably give a lot less weight to the final paper and a lot more weight to the process of thinking through an argument, but I ultimately still believe that thinking through ideas in writing is a valuable practice. Look, I do it every week.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>Surveilance or technology solution to preventing AI use is not a good solution</li>

<h2 id="toc_52">ChatGPT4 with Link Reader Plugin - Summary</h2>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p>The blog post discusses the implications of AI, particularly ChatGPT, on writing assignments in the university setting. Here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Undervaluing Writing in Universities</strong>: The author argues that universities do not value writing as they should. Most writing instruction is done by graduate students and sessional instructors, who are often underpaid and lack institutional support. The author believes that if writing were truly valued, more time and resources would be devoted to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Problem with ChatGPT</strong>: The author criticizes the use of ChatGPT for writing assignments, stating that the essays it produces are superficial and lack depth. The author suggests that the problem isn&#39;t with ChatGPT itself, but with the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. Students have been trained to write in a formulaic manner, which is why AI can mimic this style.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching Writing at Scale</strong>: The author asserts that good writing instruction cannot be scaled up. It requires small classes, time, professional development, and integration across the curriculum. The author criticizes solutions that try to address the ChatGPT problem without acknowledging this fact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity vs. Academic Integrity</strong>: The author distinguishes between academic integrity and assessment integrity. The author argues that the issue with ChatGPT is not an academic integrity issue, but an assessment integrity issue. The focus should be on improving the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI Detection and Surveillance</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection, such as Turnitin&#39;s efforts to add AI detection to their originality checker. The author argues that these are not effective solutions and only contribute to an arms race.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advice for Teachers</strong>: The author suggests that teachers should talk to students about ChatGPT and its shortcomings, evaluate for process rather than product, include reflection in assessments, and think critically about their assessments. The author advises against ramping up surveillance, banning ChatGPT, or giving up on essay writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Future</strong>: The author warns that if the current issues are not addressed, the next step could be AI marking AI essays. The author calls for more hands-on writing instruction, smaller classes, authentic assessment, relationship building, and care. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>More succinct summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> If you were to summarize your previous response into two key points, what would it be?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity and Teaching Approach</strong>: The blog post emphasizes the need for a shift in the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. It argues that the issue with AI-generated essays isn&#39;t about academic integrity but assessment integrity. The focus should be on the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI and Pedagogical Solutions</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection and advises against banning AI tools like ChatGPT. Instead, the author suggests that educators should engage students in discussions about AI&#39;s role and shortcomings in writing, evaluate the process of writing rather than just the product, and include reflection in assessments. </p></li>
