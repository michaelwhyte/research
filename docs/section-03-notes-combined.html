<li>This resource is an interview of David H. Rose, one of the creators of UDL...I am mainly using this reourse for a quote by David H. Rose...</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, we look for how well the teacher assesses what the kids have learned. We’re not big on standardized tests because they often don’t provide much in the way of actionable information—you can’t really tell why a student doesn’t know what you had hoped he or she would know. So we like to see other assessment methods—methods that can show how the student approached a problem that he or she got wrong and what parts of the lesson are working or not working for particular students. It’s not that you would never used a standardized test, but that you would never use only a standardized test. We want to see assessments that involve students creating rich products—for example, PowerPoint presentations, debates, or multimedia representations. There are all sorts of ways kids can demonstrate what they’ve learned.</p></li>

<li>I read this article...What follows is a summary created by ChatGPT4 using the Link Reader plugin</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of the article in bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The paper discusses two types of evaluation methods: Formative and Summative.</li>
<li>Formative evaluation is used to gauge a student&#39;s progress throughout a course, providing feedback to improve a program or intervention as it is implemented.</li>
<li>Summative evaluation is conducted after a program or intervention has been implemented, assessing the effectiveness of the overall program.</li>
<li>The paper compares new and classical evaluation methods.

<ul>
<li>Classical evaluation methods:

<ul>
<li>Traditional approaches</li>
<li>Often conducted at the end of a program</li>
<li>Show whether the program&#39;s goals were achieved.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New evaluation methods:

<ul>
<li>Innovative approaches</li>
<li>Frequently use recent technology and procedures</li>
<li>Mixed-method research which includes both qualitative and quantitative data sources.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various measurement and evaluation tools.

<ul>
<li>Standardized Examinations:

<ul>
<li>Easy to use, quickly implemented, and capable of testing a large number of students.</li>
<li>May not fit the precise goals of a program and can be more summative than formative.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance Measures (e.g., essays, projects, online exams, presentations):

<ul>
<li>Can evaluate from several angles</li>
<li>Boost students&#39; motivation and promote active learning.</li>
<li>Can be expensive, time-consuming, and may present additional challenges for some students.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The choice of evaluation technique should be determined by the particular objectives and setting of the evaluation. It&#39;s important for evaluators to thoroughly examine the appropriate evaluation approach and to be transparent about the methods used in the evaluation process.</p></li>

<li><p>Article on the downsides of exams and how or should they be used going forward</p></li>
<li><p>The recent emergence of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools has led to further calls to lurch back to the exam hall. The logic behind these calls is that <mark>we can’t really be sure students are doing the right thing if we are not watching them</mark>. But <mark>exam hall exams have their own problems – authenticity, assurance of learning and challenges for access</mark>...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>ChatGPT 3.5 - May 29, 2023 summary of the above text

<ul>
<li>The emergence of ChatGPT and other AI tools has sparked a desire to revert to traditional exam hall exams due to concerns about monitoring student behavior.</li>
<li>However, exam hall exams have their own drawbacks, including issues of authenticity, assurance of learning, and accessibility challenges.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">The Downsides of Exams</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Exams haven&#39;t changed in over a millenium (1300 years)</p>

<ul>
<li><mark>Today exams are rigid</mark>

<ul>
<li><mark>Students often have to follow these rules:</mark>

<ul>
<li><mark>Students are provided with a list of permitted materials they can use during the exam.</mark></li>
<li><mark>They are instructed on the specific time they need to be present in the exam building.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Assigned seating arrangements are given to each student.</mark></li>
<li><mark>Generally, students are not allowed to communicate with anyone during the exam.</mark></li>
<li><mark>If students need to use the bathroom, they are required to ask for permission in a specified manner, as it is typically the only acceptable reason to leave their seat.</mark></li>
<li>The above list is based on the article and was summarized by ChatGPT 3.5 - May 29, 2023</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The following is a big downside of exams...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><mark>Assessment is ultimately about making judgements about what students are capable of. In making these judgements, context matters. The constraints of the exam hall are a poor representation of the sorts of contexts students will need to work in when they graduate.</mark></strong>...DQ...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The context of the exam hall encourages learners to focus on exam technique and time management...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Exam hall exams may carry the largest weighting for a subject/unit but are often the least authentic and inclusive assessment...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>All Australian universities require students to demonstrate a range of learning outcomes from their course. Typically, in addition to discipline knowledges and skills, these include communication, critical thinking, global citizenship, teamwork, independence, problem-solving and information literacy...DQ...</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_5">Why Are Exams Still Suggested</h2>

<p><strong>I asked ChatGPT to review a passage of text from the article and list out the reasons why institutes still suggest exams as an assessment...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 3.5</p>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you review this text and list out why institute still request exams as an assessment type:..</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Certainly! Here are the reasons why institutes still request exam hall exams as an assessment type, based on the provided text:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Addressing concerns about cheating:</strong> Exam hall exams are seen as a way to mitigate cheating, especially with the increasing rates of cheating observed in online delivery and the rise of contract cheating.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges in delivering assessment at scale:</strong> Conducting exams in a controlled environment allows institutes to efficiently assess a large number of students simultaneously, ensuring standardization and ease of administration.</li>
<li><strong>Cheating detection:</strong> Although cheating can still occur even with exam hall exams, they provide some level of detection compared to other assessment methods.</li>
<li><p><strong>New challenges posed by artificial intelligence:</strong> The emergence of artificial intelligence tools introduces new challenges in maintaining exam integrity, which may contribute to the continued use of exam hall exams as a more traditional and controlled approach to assessment.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Resorting to exam hall exams won’t solve these challenges as more authentic assessment is required by students, industry and community partners and professional accreditation bodies...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>Exams are not immune to cheating...</p>

<ul>
<li>Exams have fostered a cottage industry of cheating since their earliest days, and they continue to be the target of industrious cheaters pedalling a range of custom hardware such as cheating calculators...DQ...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Thinking that a switch back to exams solves the problem of cheating is not just naïve, it’s dangerous...DQ...</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_6">Definition of an Invigilated Exam</h2>

<li>An <strong>invigilated exam</strong> refers to an examination that is closely monitored and supervised by invigilators or proctors. Invigilators ensure that the exam environment is secure and that students follow the designated rules and regulations throughout the examination process. They maintain order, prevent cheating or misconduct, and ensure fairness and integrity in the assessment. Invigilated exams are typically conducted in a controlled setting, such as an exam hall or classroom, where students are closely observed to ensure compliance with exam guidelines.</li>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Link Reader plugin</p>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Can you summarize this article into a few key bullet points...focusing on the disadvantes of exams and why more authentic exams may be more appropriate in a world with AI-LLMs...Here is the article: https://blogs.deakin.edu.au/cradle/2023/01/16/1300-years-is-long-enough-its-pens-down-for-the-exam-hall/</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Here are the key points from the article discussing the disadvantages of traditional exam hall exams and the potential benefits of more authentic assessments, especially in the context of AI-LLMs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Traditional exam hall exams are seen as exercises in restriction and endurance, with strict rules and conditions that don&#39;t reflect real-world work environments. </p></li>
<li><p>The context of the exam hall encourages learners to focus on exam technique and time management, rather than the application of knowledge and skills in realistic scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>These exams often carry the largest weighting for a subject/unit but are often the least authentic and inclusive assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><mark>Exam hall exams ignore a large range of intended learning outcomes of study, such as communication, critical thinking, global citizenship, teamwork, independence, problem-solving, and information literacy.</mark></strong> </p></li>
<li><p>They also fail to provide crucial feedback that fosters learning, as students are not permitted to revise and improve and often have very limited access to find out what went &#39;wrong&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>Two main drivers for exam hall exams are concerns about cheating and challenges in delivering assessment at scale. However, resorting to exam hall exams won&#39;t solve these challenges as more authentic assessment is required by students, industry and community partners, and professional accreditation bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>The article suggests that there is no perfect singular solution to the problem of cheating, and instead, we should be looking for layers of approaches that contribute to the security of our degrees at a program level.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors argue that the challenge of providing equitable assessment at scale is considerable but the online environment can scale-up well. They mention that Deakin University has moved their exam-hall exams into a range of online assessment tasks including more authentic tasks and online formats for end-of-semester assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors conclude that in a digital world, exam hall exams are an anachronism that we can do without. They advocate for a shift in focus from the process of managing exams to working on good assessment design.</p></li>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> May 29, 2023</p>

<p>The article discusses the concerns around AI-assisted plagiarism, specifically with the use of OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT, an AI-based text generator that can write convincing essays. Here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>AI-Assisted Plagiarism</strong>: There are growing concerns in academia about the potential misuse of ChatGPT for cheating in homework and exam coursework, as it can provide convincing human-sounding answers to a range of questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watermarking AI Output</strong>: To counter the risk of AI-assisted plagiarism, OpenAI is working on a system to &quot;watermark&quot; the bot&#39;s output. This involves subtly tweaking the choice of words selected by ChatGPT in a way that wouldn&#39;t be noticeable to a reader, but would be statistically predictable to anyone looking for signs of machine-generated text.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AIgiarism Policies</strong>: Since the release of ChatGPT, various organizations have instituted specific policies against submitting AI-generated text as one&#39;s own work. For example, Stack Overflow, a Q&amp;A site for programmers, banned users from submitting responses written by ChatGPT due to its high rate of incorrect answers.</p></li>

<h2 id="toc_14">What is a Summative Assessment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Weeks or months of study in a classroom generally culminate in a summative assessment. This refers to a test that evaluates a student’s comprehension of the material covered thus far...DQ...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_15">Pros of Summative Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Summative assessments offer motivation for students to study and engage in class, especially as grades become important for college admissions and future career prospects.</p></li>
<li><p>These assessments provide valuable insights to teachers by revealing the effectiveness of their instruction. </p>

<ul>
<li>If a class consistently performs poorly on a particular exam, it indicates the need for instructional adjustments rather than blaming the students&#39; abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Summative assessments serve as indicators of overall student performance and understanding at the end of a learning period, allowing teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching methods and curriculum.</p></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT 3.5 - May 25, 2023</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_16">Cons of Summative Assessments</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Summative assessments can lead to teachers &quot;teaching to the test,&quot; focusing on specific test formats or content rather than promoting holistic learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The pressure to perform well on summative assessments may result in students spending excessive time on test-specific exercises, neglecting broader skills and natural learning processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Even well-prepared students can encounter difficulties during summative assessments, particularly if they struggle with test anxiety or face questions that trip them up. This can affect the accuracy of the assessment as a reflection of their actual knowledge and understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Summative assessments, due to their limitations, may not always provide the most accurate representation of a student&#39;s overall learning and can fall short in capturing the breadth of knowledge and skills acquired.</p></li>

<h1 id="toc_23">03-00 ChatGPT 4 - Are Essays Authentic Assessments</h1>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Bing</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Are essays considered summative traditional assessments or authentic assessments? </p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Essays can be considered either traditional summative assessments or authentic assessments, depending on how they are structured and used.</p>

<p>In the traditional sense, essays are often used as summative assessments at the end of a unit or course to evaluate a student&#39;s understanding of the material. These essays are typically structured around specific prompts and are evaluated based on the student&#39;s ability to organize their thoughts, use appropriate language, and demonstrate their understanding of the content. This is a more traditional approach, and the assessment is often focused on the product (the final essay) rather than the process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, essays can also be used as authentic assessments. Authentic assessments are those that involve complex tasks, real-world contexts, and require the application of knowledge and skills, rather than recall or recognition. For example, an essay assignment that asks students to research a real-world issue, develop a position, and argue for it effectively could be considered an authentic assessment. In this case, the assessment might also take into account the process the student went through to research and develop their essay, not just the final product.</p>

<p>So, the categorization of an essay as a traditional summative assessment or an authentic assessment would depend on the specific assignment, its goals, and how it is evaluated. </p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Are you able to provide sources to your previous response?</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, essays are considered a type of traditional summative assessment. Summative assessments are used at the end of a unit or lesson to determine what students have learned. They often include tests or exams but also options like essays, projects, and presentations​ [1]​.</p>

<p>On the other hand, authentic assessments involve the application of knowledge and skills in real-world situations, scenarios, or problems. These assessments create a student-centered learning experience by providing students opportunities to problem-solve, inquire, and create new knowledge and meaning. Authentic assessments can also be referred to as alternative assessments or performance-based assessments, which are considered &quot;alternatives&quot; to traditional high-stakes tests or research papers, like essays. It is also important to note that authentic assessments can be used both formatively (during instruction) and summatively (when the instruction is over) [​2]​.</p>

<p>However, the distinction between traditional and authentic assessment is not always clear-cut. An essay can also be seen as an authentic assessment if it is designed to reflect real-world tasks or scenarios. For example, writing an essay as a form of policy analysis or a business proposal could be seen as an authentic assessment as it simulates a task that might be performed in a professional setting. This highlights the flexibility and complexity in categorizing assessments. The classification often depends on the context and the design of the assessment.</p>

<h1 id="toc_24">03-00 ChatGPT 4 - Limitations of Traditional Summative Assessments</h1>

<p><strong>Model:</strong> ChatGPT 4 with Bing</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> May 25, 2023</p>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What are some of the Limitations of Traditional Summative Assessments in education</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>

<p>Traditional summative assessments, such as standardized tests, have been a cornerstone of education systems around the world for many years. They provide a way to measure a student&#39;s knowledge and skills at a particular point in time, typically at the end of a unit, course, or academic year. However, they also come with several limitations:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Individualization:</strong> Summative assessments are typically standardized, meaning they do not take into account the unique learning styles, strengths, or areas for improvement of individual students.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Scope of Assessment:</strong> These assessments often focus on content knowledge and recall, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of skills such as critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Feedback:</strong> Because summative assessments take place at the end of a learning period, students may not receive feedback in time to improve their understanding or correct misunderstandings. This can hinder learning progress.</li>
<li><strong>Stress and Pressure:</strong> High-stakes testing can cause significant stress and anxiety among students, which can negatively affect their performance and overall learning experience.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow View of Success:</strong> Summative assessments often value a narrow definition of academic success, primarily based on test scores. This can overlook other important aspects of student growth and development, such as social-emotional learning, resilience, and character development.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Teaching to the Test:</strong> When test scores become the primary measure of success, there&#39;s a risk that educators may &quot;teach to the test,&quot; focusing on content that will be on the exam rather than fostering a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.</li>
<li><strong>Equity Concerns:</strong> Standardized tests may not account for socioeconomic, cultural, and linguistic differences among students. As a result, these tests may not accurately reflect a student&#39;s abilities or potential.</li>
<li><strong>Validity and Reliability Issues:</strong> The accuracy and consistency of test scores can be influenced by many factors, including the wording of questions, student interpretation of questions, and testing conditions. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Are you able to provide sources to your previous response?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ChatGPT did not quite do as I ask, but it did utilize Bing, searched the web and came up with a similar list, but this time it linked to sources to back up what it was saying. Of courses these sources have to be checked...</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Here are the limitations of traditional summative assessments, as supported by sources:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Summative assessments, particularly high-stakes ones, can impact students&#39; motivation. Poor performance on these assessments can lead to lowered self-esteem, which in turn can reduce students&#39; willingness to invest effort required for future academic success​ [1]​.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability and Validity:</strong> For an assessment to be free of distortion, it must accurately reflect the whole of the material it&#39;s intended to cover, including the way the material has been taught. Inconsistencies across tasks and how they are marked, both internally within the assessment and externally across different versions, can lead to reliability and validity errors, thus compromising the purpose of summative assessment, which is to accurately measure student performance​ [1]​.</li>
<li><strong>Curriculum Distortion:</strong> External summative assessments used to judge teacher and school performance can negatively impact what occurs in the classroom. Teachers often feel enormous pressure to explicitly &quot;teach the test&quot; at the expense of other curriculum goals and objectives, which can distort the learning process and limit the breadth and depth of students&#39; learning experiences [​1, ​​2]​.</li>
<li><strong>Bias:</strong> Summative assessments with limited means of expression, particularly large-scale standardized tests that use multiple choice for automated grading, may unfairly disadvantage certain groups of students, including non-native speakers with language or cultural barriers, those with physical or learning disabilities, or those who do not perform well under the pressure of the testing conditions [​1]​.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Summative assessments may measure the wrong things. The ways in which students are assessed may not provide accurate information about their understanding or mastery of the material [​1]​.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Pressure:</strong> Even students with excellent knowledge of the material may run into questions that trip them up, especially if they get nervous under pressure. As a result, summative assessments may not always accurately reflect learning​ [2]​.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Sorry, VP-Finances reading this (lol, imagine a VP-Finance reading this), but it’s just not possible to scale up good writing instruction. Writing is hard work and it’s heart work — it involves revision and effort. It needs attention and care. It requires investment: small classes, time, professional development, and integration across the curriculum...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>This is true, writing well is a full time pursuit...A profession...Most people do not have time to dedicate to perfecting their writing...especially in a world that just needs the infortmation quickly. As long as the writing is clear, it is often good enough for the everyday world...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If ChatGPT didn’t work for the kinds of writing we assign and assess at the undergraduate level, we would have nothing to worry about. And for that reason, <mark>I don’t think this is an academic integrity issue — I think it’s an assessment integrity issue</mark>. We treat those like they are the same thing, but they’re not...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology is not the issue (ChatGPT) it is how we are assessing that is more of the issue...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This quote is not really related...then again, maybe it is...I got a kick out of this line...
-<mark>Turnitin, a company with the ethical core of a rotting banana...</mark></p></li>
<li><p>...we cannot simply issue blanket bans. This will be as embedded in the process of writing as grammar and spell checkers are now — which, too, was once considered an unthinkable crutch for bad writers to lean on...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology and norms evolve...I agree...In the future, AI assisted writing will just be the way it is done...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But much like most of us used to tell our students to stay away from Wikipedia (which is a bad comparison on many levels, not least because it was always misguided advice), we have a losing battle on our hands. It was always better to talk about how to use Wikipedia responsibly than to imagine we could keep students away from it...DQ...</p>

<ul>
<li>If a tool is used in the real world, it is better not to keep students from it...Instead we should show students how to use it...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_26">Solutions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Talk to students about ChatGPT. What are its problems and shortcomings? How do you see the work it produces as falling short of your standards? What do you see as the AI implications in your discipline?</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate for process, not just product. When we only collect the finished product, there&#39;s little incentive for students to learn the process — and the kind of thinking essay writing requires means a lot of process work. Help students to understand <em>how</em> to write well in your discipline and how to establish good habits around writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Include reflection in your assessments, both in terms of how the content is relevant to students and in terms of the process they undertook. Thinking though how an assignment went (especially before the instructor marks it) can really help students to develop skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Think critically about your assessments. If you assign essays, do you have a reason for that? And do you provide essay writing instruction? The essay is often the default mode of assessment, but that puts a lot of pressure on the final product, and often students have little support in developing it. Are there other ways to assess learning that might be more effective?</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>The above 4 points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>The above 4 points paraphrased</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Evaluate the process that led to the product</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reflect on the process of developing the product</li>
<li>Are your assessments relevant</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_27">What Not To Do</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t ramp up surveillance or look for a technological solution to what is ultimately a pedagogical problem. That&#39;s an arms race and I can tell you right now, education does not have the means to win it.</p></li>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t try banning ChatGPT. First of all, once it&#39;s packaged with Microsoft it&#39;s all game over anyway. It won&#39;t go away because we stick our heads in the sand.</p></li>
<li><p>I wouldn&#39;t give up on the essay. I would probably give a lot less weight to the final paper and a lot more weight to the process of thinking through an argument, but I ultimately still believe that thinking through ideas in writing is a valuable practice. Look, I do it every week.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>The above 4 points are ...DQ...</p></li>
<li><p>The above 4 points paraphrased</p></li>

<ol>
<li>Surveilance or technology solution to preventing AI use is not a good solution</li>

<li><p><strong>Undervaluing Writing in Universities</strong>: The author argues that universities do not value writing as they should. Most writing instruction is done by graduate students and sessional instructors, who are often underpaid and lack institutional support. The author believes that if writing were truly valued, more time and resources would be devoted to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Problem with ChatGPT</strong>: The author criticizes the use of ChatGPT for writing assignments, stating that the essays it produces are superficial and lack depth. The author suggests that the problem isn&#39;t with ChatGPT itself, but with the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. Students have been trained to write in a formulaic manner, which is why AI can mimic this style.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching Writing at Scale</strong>: The author asserts that good writing instruction cannot be scaled up. It requires small classes, time, professional development, and integration across the curriculum. The author criticizes solutions that try to address the ChatGPT problem without acknowledging this fact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity vs. Academic Integrity</strong>: The author distinguishes between academic integrity and assessment integrity. The author argues that the issue with ChatGPT is not an academic integrity issue, but an assessment integrity issue. The focus should be on improving the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI Detection and Surveillance</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection, such as Turnitin&#39;s efforts to add AI detection to their originality checker. The author argues that these are not effective solutions and only contribute to an arms race.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advice for Teachers</strong>: The author suggests that teachers should talk to students about ChatGPT and its shortcomings, evaluate for process rather than product, include reflection in assessments, and think critically about their assessments. The author advises against ramping up surveillance, banning ChatGPT, or giving up on essay writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Future</strong>: The author warns that if the current issues are not addressed, the next step could be AI marking AI essays. The author calls for more hands-on writing instruction, smaller classes, authentic assessment, relationship building, and care. </p></li>
</ol>

<li><p><strong>Assessment Integrity and Teaching Approach</strong>: The blog post emphasizes the need for a shift in the way writing is taught and assessed in universities. It argues that the issue with AI-generated essays isn&#39;t about academic integrity but assessment integrity. The focus should be on the process of developing an essay as a learning experience, rather than treating it as a product that demonstrates learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI and Pedagogical Solutions</strong>: The author criticizes solutions that involve increased surveillance or AI detection and advises against banning AI tools like ChatGPT. Instead, the author suggests that educators should engage students in discussions about AI&#39;s role and shortcomings in writing, evaluate the process of writing rather than just the product, and include reflection in assessments. </p></li>
