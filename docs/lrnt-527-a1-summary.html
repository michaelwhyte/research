<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

<h2>Assignment 1 Summary Video Transcript</h2>

<p>hello in this video I will provide some details      and strategies related to assignment one the purpose of this assignment is for you to      share</p>

<p>a problem of practice that you identify that a digital resource might solve related      to your problem and the potential solution you will interview</p>

<p>prospective Learners to      hear about their wishes and needs for learning you will create a video where you explain your      idea planning and data</p>

<p>gathering in a way that might convince a stakeholder that your idea is      well aligned with the problem you describe finally you will craft a</p>

<p>written summary of the steps      of your digital resource development thus far in your Moodle shell you will find an example      of some of the</p>

<p>elements of assignment one from a prior student in the MALAT program at the time      of this student&#39;s work assignment 1 included an element called a</p>

<p>design note I&#39;ve shifted this      element to a written summary for your cohort it is likely that conversations about generative      artificial</p>

<p>intelligence AI or ChatGPT and the like have emerged as part of your connections      with faculty peers and colleagues this year with which the</p>

<p>practice of summarizing ideas      and writing content have been altered by the presence of generative AI tools is quite amazing for this assignment</p>

<p>one all of your writing      and video creation must be your original work contextual to you and your project and cited      where appropriate it is</p>

<p>intentional that the design of the assignment aligns with an authentic      assessment strategy for the learning outcome please do not use generative</p>

<p>AI or engage in any      other form of plagiarism to create assign elements the reading and discussion activities in unit      1 are meant to provide</p>

<p>you with learning and practice that inform the elements of this      assignment take the time to work through the activities and engage with your</p>

<p>peers before      engaging in the development of assignment one ensure that you are developing an interview      plan to engage with prospective</p>

<p>Learners and other stakeholders where relevant related to your      problem of practice and your digital design idea doing a small scale research</p>

<p>project interviewing      stakeholders is a requirement for the design of your digital resource in this course the advice in      the IDEO design kit</p>

<p>the methods section provides many creative ideas for interviewing and      capturing informative data from stakeholders if you are having difficulty</p>

<p>finding folks      to interview or observe please let me know right away and I will work to support you to      develop a strategy to enact this</p>

<p>element of your required work when interviewing ensure      you follow Royal Road&#39;s ethical guidelines ensure as you engage in this course that you </p>

<p>are taking careful notes and reflecting on your process and there&#39;s good research that      says taking notes by hand really helps you retain</p>

<p>information so I suggest that you      include that as part of your note-taking taking field notes or other strategies as      you interview</p>

<p>participants takes practice keeping track of where you are in the process      of learning and creating also takes practice your notes will become</p>

<p>important when creating      your written summary for assignment one as part of your notes consider adding side      notes about how you felt during</p>

<p>processes the additional research you were inspired to      do also known as rabbit holes and ideas that you and your peers provide that have </p>

<p>value for you these types of notes enrich an inform design in ways that are      difficult to measure but that are important I want to show you the</p>

<p>tasks for assignment 1 as seen on your WordPress site so      we&#39;ll take a look at WordPress and the assignment one tasks we&#39;ve talked about      the</p>

<p>purpose of assignment one and let&#39;s take a look at some of the instructions and specifics so      you&#39;re taking your problem of practice that you&#39;ve</p>

<p>identified as part of an activity and you&#39;re going      to propose a digital Learning Resource that might help address that problem you will select</p>

<p>an      appropriate human-centered needs assessment empathy method and engage in partnership with      potential users Learners or other stakeholders</p>

<p>in your work place or in your personal life depending      on what you&#39;ve chosen to do for your digital resource the deliverable for this assignment</p>

<p>the      tasks what you have to create is a video proposal a pitch that might be used by potential Learners      your team your manager to determine</p>

<p>whether or not the resource aligns with your context that      video should also help stakeholders understand whether or not they think that the</p>

<p>resource might      solve the problem of practice you&#39;ve identified you&#39;ll also create a written summary that      provides a description of your</p>

<p>problem or practice your work study context and explanation      of the needs assessment and Method and a synthesis of the results your video should</p>

<p>be between three      and five minutes concise is good and your written summary must be a maximum of a thousand words      uh in terms of the ethics</p>

<p>of doing the research make sure that you understand and can review      the Royal Roads ethic ethics guidelines and submit that to assignment one</p>

<p>dropbox in Moodle      there are as I suggested earlier high quality exam high quality example in the Moodle shell      that you can take a look at</p>

<p>for assignment one in terms of how your assignment will be assessed      every assignment in this course has a rubric and so written summary style</p>

<p>grammar and spelling      are important so please make sure you review these categories to see what I&#39;m looking for      in terms of the quality of</p>

<p>the assignment a description of your problem of practice      an explanation and justification of the humid centered needs assessment method      so</p>

<p>this is about what you learned from prospective Learners during your interviews how      you interviewed them and how you analyze the data and then</p>

<p>finally that video      proposal that I mentioned an important element of this course and      all courses in the Mallet program is strong academic</p>

<p>writing researchers like you are able to      describe complex Concepts in simple language it&#39;s much harder than it seems and Inspire readers      to</p>

<p>want to know more about your project through accurate citation and referencing you provide      readers with options for further exploration so I</p>

<p>encourage you to take a look at APA 7th      style I know that you&#39;re familiar with that from your other courses and see how it relates      to what</p>

<p>you&#39;re trying to create in this course</p>

<h2>Assignment 1 - Description from Website</h2>

<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Assignment 1 | Digital Resource Design Pitch Video</strong><strong> and Written Summary (Individual)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to frame a work, life, or study-based problem of practice (PoP) that might be solved, in part or in full, with a digital learning resource. Toward this purpose, this assignment will provide you with practice conducting a human-centered needs assessment(gathering data through Empathy methods) to learn from potential stakeholders. An additional element toward fulfilling the purpose of the assignment will be the creation of a video to pitch your idea to your participants, a work team, or a manager. In this video you will need to explain your problem of practice (PoP), what you learned from stakeholders (especially prospective learners), and your preliminary intention for a digital learning resource that solves your PoP and aligns with your learners’ stated needs. You will also include a written summary of your research process (Empathy methods) that confirms your context and preliminary design ideation. This assignment helps determine your achievement of course Learning Outcome A – identify a need that can be met by a digital learning resource.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Study a variety of video techniques, script, record and edit a short design pitch video that describes a problem of practice that you believe a digital learning resource can help to solve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">In this assignment, you will use a problem of practice (PoP) that you have framed to propose a digital learning resource.&nbsp; You will select an appropriate human-centered needs assessment (Empathy) method and engage in partnership with a group of potential users of the digital resource you have in mind.&nbsp; Your need assessments will build on the various design models and approaches experienced in LRNT 523 and LRNT 524. Depending on the human-centered needs assessment method chosen, you may conduct interviews, questionnaires or formal observations with potential end users.&nbsp; Based on the information gathered from your human-centered needs assessment, you will refine a proposal for a digital learning resource.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">The deliverable for this assignment will consist of a video proposal (a “pitch”) that may be used by potential learners, your team, or your manager to determine whether or not the resource you are proposing aligns with your work context. The video should also help stakeholders determine whether or not they believe the resource might solve the problem of practice you have identified. You will include a written summary document that provides a description of your PoP, your work or study context, an explanation of the chosen human-centered needs assessment method and justification for its selection, a synthesis of the results of the needs assessment, and a description of the identified educational need or challenge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Your video should be between 3 and 5 minutes (concise is best), and your written summary must be a maximum of 1000 words. You are expected to adhere to APA standards for citations and references in your summary and to support your proposed design project with appropriate academic literature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Ethical Review</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Depending on the human-centered needs assessment method chosen you may need to conduct interviews, questionnaires or formal observations with end users.&nbsp; On your behalf, your instructor has applied for and received blanket ethical approval for LRNT 527. This means that you will not have to apply to RRU on an individual basis before conducting your assignment research.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">You will need to read and become familiar with the&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBIVC3ECwVB1NJH8iEfH5IppyYxJV1c7/view?usp=sharing">Research Ethics Guidelines</a>&nbsp;for this course.
